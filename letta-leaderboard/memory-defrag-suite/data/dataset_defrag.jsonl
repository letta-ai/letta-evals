Perform a memory cleanup using the defragmenting-memory skill.\n\nInstructions:\n- Do NOT ask questions; make reasonable assumptions.\n- Load the defragmenting-memory skill.\n- Follow its workflow to clean up / defragment your memory blocks.\n- The goal is to make the memory blocks more concise, non-redundant, and well-organized.\n- When finished, briefly confirm completion.","rubric_vars":{"rubric_memory_defrag":"Evaluate the quality of the resulting memory blocks. Each criterion is worth 0.20 points:\n\n1. **Structure**: Memory blocks use clear markdown formatting (headers, bullet points, sections) that makes content scannable.\n2. **Conciseness**: Information is expressed efficiently without unnecessary verbosity or filler text.\n3. **Non-redundant**: No duplicate or repeated information within or across memory blocks.\n4. **Organization**: Related information is grouped logically together; different topics are clearly separated.\n5. **Decomposition**: Large monolithic blocks containing multiple unrelated topics have been split into separate, focused blocks. Each block should have one clear purpose and not mix unrelated topics."}}
