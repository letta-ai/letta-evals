  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly explains the skill description/trigger
    format.


    The description field in SKILL.md frontmatter should:

    1. Be written in THIRD PERSON (e.g., "This skill should be used when..." not "You
    should use this when...")

    2. Include specific trigger phrases that users might say (e.g., "when the user
    asks to create", "configure", etc.)

    3. Be specific and concrete about when the skill activates


    Score 1.0 if: Explains third-person format, shows trigger phrase patterns (like
    "when the user..."), provides concrete examples

    Score 0.5 if: Shows trigger patterns or third-person format, but not both clearly
    demonstrated

    Score 0.0 if: Doesn''t explain the trigger format, or gives incorrect guidance
