  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response explains how to reference supporting files
    from SKILL.md.


    The correct approach is:

    1. List or mention the reference files in SKILL.md itself

    2. Use the path format references/filename.md

    3. Optionally include a "Resources" or "Additional Resources" section

    4. Briefly describe what each file contains so Claude knows when to consult it


    Score 1.0 if: Explains referencing files in SKILL.md, shows proper path format
    (references/), and suggests describing file contents or organizing in a section

    Score 0.5 if: Mentions referencing in SKILL.md and shows path format, but lacks
    guidance on organization

    Score 0.0 if: Doesn''t explain how to make references discoverable, or gives incorrect
    approach
