    For a large skill (8000 words), the correct approach is:

    1. Keep SKILL.md lean (ideally 1500-2000 words, max 3000-5000)

    2. Move detailed/advanced content to references/ directory

    3. SKILL.md should contain core instructions; references/ holds patterns, detailed
    guides, etc.

    4. This approach optimizes context window usage - SKILL.md loads on trigger, references
    load on demand


    Score 1.0 if: Recommends splitting, mentions references/ directory, explains what
    goes where (core vs detailed), mentions keeping SKILL.md lean/concise

    Score 0.5 if: Recommends splitting and mentions references/, but lacks clear guidance
    on organization

    Score 0.0 if: Suggests putting everything in SKILL.md, or doesn''t mention the
    references/ directory
