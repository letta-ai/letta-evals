    Code skills.


    Claude Code skills should use IMPERATIVE/INFINITIVE form ("Check the code", "Review
    changes")

    and avoid SECOND-PERSON language ("You should check", "You need to review").


    Check for:

    1. Does the response avoid second-person patterns like "you should", "you need
    to", "you can", "you must"?

    2. Does the response use imperative verbs at the start of steps (check, review,
    analyze, verify, ensure, examine, etc.)?

    3. Does the response include numbered steps (at least 4-5 as requested)?


    Score 1.0 if: No second-person language, uses imperative form for most steps,
    has numbered steps

    Score 0.5 if: Minimal second-person usage (1-2 instances), some imperative verbs
    present

    Score 0.0 if: Heavy use of second-person language throughout, or no clear process
    steps
