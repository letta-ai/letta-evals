prompt: 'I want to create a hook that checks if code being written follows our

  team''s coding standards. The check requires understanding context and

  making nuanced decisions.


  Should I use a prompt-based hook or a command hook? Explain why.

    context-aware, nuanced decisions.


    The user''s task (checking coding standards with nuanced decisions) is well-suited
    for prompt hooks because:

    - Prompt hooks use an LLM for context-aware reasoning

    - They can handle nuanced, flexible decisions

    - They understand natural language and edge cases

    - They can reason about code quality and style


    Command hooks are better for:

    - Deterministic, fast checks

    - Simple exact-match rules

    - File system operations

    - Quick validation without LLM overhead


    Score 1.0 if: Response recommends prompt-based hooks AND provides at least 2 good
    reasons (context-aware, nuanced, flexible, reasoning, understands edge cases,
    LLM-based) AND contrasts with when command hooks are appropriate (deterministic,
    fast, simple)


    Score 0.5 if: Response recommends prompt-based hooks with at least 1 relevant
    reason for why they''re better suited for this task


    Score 0.0 if: Response recommends command hooks for this task, or does not make
    a clear recommendation, or provides no reasoning
