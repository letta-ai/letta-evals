  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly identifies the available hook events
    in Claude Code.


    Core hook events (most important):

    - PreToolUse: Fires before a tool is executed

    - PostToolUse: Fires after a tool completes

    - Stop: Fires when the agent stops/completes

    - UserPromptSubmit: Fires when the user submits a prompt

    - SessionStart: Fires when a session begins


    Additional events:

    - SessionEnd: Fires when a session ends

    - Notification: For notification events

    - SubAgent: Related to subagent operations


    Score 1.0 if: Response correctly identifies 4 or more of the core events (PreToolUse,
    PostToolUse, Stop, UserPromptSubmit, SessionStart) AND explains when they fire
    (before/after/when they trigger)


    Score 0.5 if: Response correctly identifies 2-3 core events, or identifies multiple
    events with some timing explanation


    Score 0.0 if: Response identifies fewer than 2 hook events, or provides mostly
    incorrect/fabricated event names
