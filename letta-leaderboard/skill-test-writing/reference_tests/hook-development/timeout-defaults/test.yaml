  between command hooks and prompt hooks?

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly explains timeout defaults for Claude
    Code hooks.


    Key timeout values:

    - Command hooks (bash/script execution): 60 seconds default

    - Prompt hooks (LLM-based): 30 seconds default (faster since they''re typically
    simpler)

    - The timeouts can be configured/overridden


    Score 1.0 if: Response correctly identifies both timeout values - command hooks
    at 60 seconds AND prompt hooks at 30 seconds


    Score 0.5 if: Response correctly identifies one timeout value with appropriate
    context (e.g., mentioning that different hook types have different timeouts, or
    that timeouts are configurable)


    Score 0.0 if: Response does not provide specific timeout values, or provides incorrect
    values without the correct ones
