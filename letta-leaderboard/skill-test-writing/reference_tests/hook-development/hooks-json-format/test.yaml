  prompt: "Evaluate whether the response correctly explains how to configure hooks\
    \ for Claude Code plugins.\n\nKey concepts:\n- The configuration file is hooks/hooks.json\
    \ (or just hooks.json in the hooks directory)\n- The file contains a \"hooks\"\
    \ array\n- Each hook entry has fields like:\n  - \"type\": The event type (e.g.,\
    \ PreToolUse, PostToolUse)\n  - \"matcher\": Pattern to match tools/events\n \
    \ - \"command\" or \"prompt\": The hook implementation\n\nScore 1.0 if: Response\
    \ identifies the correct file path (hooks.json or hooks/hooks.json) AND shows\
    \ the JSON structure with the hooks array AND includes at least 2 of the key fields\
    \ (type, matcher, command/prompt)\n\nScore 0.5 if: Response identifies the correct\
    \ file AND shows either the hooks array structure OR the key fields, with some\
    \ JSON example\n\nScore 0.0 if: Response does not identify hooks.json as the configuration\
    \ file, or provides a fundamentally incorrect structure\n"
