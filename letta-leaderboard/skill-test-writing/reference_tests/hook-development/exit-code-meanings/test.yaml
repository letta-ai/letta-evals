  a hook

  returns each of these?

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly explains exit code meanings for
    Claude Code hooks.


    Key concepts:

    - Exit code 0: Success/continue - the operation proceeds normally, the hook allows
    the action

    - Exit code 2: Blocking error - the hook prevents/blocks/stops the operation (particularly
    for PreToolUse hooks)

    - Stderr can be used to provide error messages when blocking

    - This blocking mechanism is especially relevant for PreToolUse hooks


    Score 1.0 if: Response correctly explains both exit codes - that 0 means success/continue/allow
    AND that 2 means block/error/stop/prevent the operation


    Score 0.5 if: Response correctly explains one exit code with appropriate context
    (e.g., mentions stderr for error messages, or that this applies to PreToolUse
    hooks)


    Score 0.0 if: Response does not correctly explain either exit code''s meaning,
    or gets the meanings reversed
