    The response should demonstrate knowledge of:

    1. The --push-to flag for pushing to a new repository

    2. SQL query usage (--sql flag or SELECT statement)

    3. WHERE clause for filtering the data


    Score 1.0 if: Response shows --push-to flag with SQL query AND WHERE clause for
    filtering, demonstrating the complete filter-and-push workflow.

    Score 0.8 if: Response shows --push-to with SQL query or command usage, but doesn''t
    explicitly show filtering.

    Score 0.6 if: Response shows --push-to with sql_manager.py but incomplete query
    details.

    Score 0.4 if: Response mentions --push-to flag OR shows query/transform with SQL.

    Score 0.0 if: Response does not demonstrate knowledge of the push workflow for
    filtered datasets.
