    The response should explain common Excel formula errors:

    1. #REF! = invalid cell reference (deleted rows/columns, wrong range)
    2. #DIV/0! = division by zero (check denominator before dividing)
    3. Prevention: validate ranges, use IFERROR, check denominators

    Score 0 if doesn't explain the meaning of these errors.
    Score 0.5 if explains meaning but no prevention strategies.
    Score 1 if explains both errors and how to prevent them.
