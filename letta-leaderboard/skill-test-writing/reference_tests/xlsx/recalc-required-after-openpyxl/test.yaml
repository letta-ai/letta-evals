  I created an Excel file with openpyxl containing formulas, but when I open it the formula cells show 0 or are blank. What's happening?

    The response should explain the openpyxl formula recalculation issue:

    1. openpyxl writes formulas as strings but does NOT calculate values
    2. Excel recalculates when opened, but other tools may not
    3. Need to use recalc.py script or LibreOffice to calculate values

    Score 0 if doesn't identify that openpyxl doesn't calculate formulas.
    Score 0.5 if explains the issue but no solution.
    Score 1 if explains openpyxl limitation and recommends recalc/LibreOffice.
