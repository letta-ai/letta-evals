  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly describes Claude Code agent color
    options and usage guidelines.


    The available colors are: blue, cyan, green, yellow, magenta, red


    Guidelines suggest using colors to:

    - Visually distinguish different agent types

    - Match color semantics to agent purpose (e.g., red for security/critical, yellow
    for caution, green for analysis)

    - Maintain consistency across similar agents


    Score 1.0 if: Lists at least 4 of the 6 colors AND provides meaningful guidelines
    for when to use different colors (semantic associations or visual identification
    purposes)

    Score 0.5 if: Lists at least 4 colors without guidelines, OR lists 2-3 colors
    with good context about their purpose

    Score 0.0 if: Lists fewer than 2 colors or doesn''t address the color options
