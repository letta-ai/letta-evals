    PowerPoint without XML parsing.


    The ideal solution involves:

    - Using the markitdown tool/library

    - Can be run as: python -m markitdown file.pptx

    - Converts PowerPoint content to Markdown format

    - Quick and simple approach that avoids XML parsing


    Score 1.0 if: Response recommends markitdown AND shows command syntax (e.g., python
    -m markitdown or markitdown CLI)

    Score 0.8 if: Response recommends markitdown and mentions markdown conversion

    Score 0.6 if: Response mentions markitdown or the python module approach

    Score 0.4 if: Response suggests markdown conversion with a quick/simple approach
    but doesn''t specifically mention markitdown

    Score 0.0 if: Response does not provide a practical non-XML text extraction method
