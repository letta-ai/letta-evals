    The response should describe the html2pptx workflow:

    1. First READ html2pptx.md completely (mandatory)
    2. Create HTML files for each slide with proper dimensions
    3. Run JavaScript with html2pptx.js library to convert and save
    4. Visual validation with thumbnail.py

    Score 0 if doesn't mention html2pptx workflow or reading the documentation.
    Score 0.5 if mentions html2pptx but missing key steps.
    Score 1 if shows complete workflow: read docs -> create HTML -> convert with JS -> validate.
