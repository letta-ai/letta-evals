prompt: 'I need to analyze the color scheme of an existing PowerPoint presentation.

  The presentation has been unpacked to a directory.


  1. What file path contains the theme color definitions?

  2. What XML element defines the color scheme?

  3. What XML element would I look for to find the accent colors?


  Give me the file path and both XML element names.

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly identifies the OOXML theme color
    locations in PowerPoint files.


    The response should demonstrate knowledge of:

    1. Theme file location: The theme colors are stored in ppt/theme/theme1.xml (or
    similar path under ppt/theme/)

    2. Color scheme element: The a:clrScheme XML element defines the color scheme

    3. Accent color elements: Accent colors use elements like a:accent1, a:accent2,
    etc.


    Score 1.0 if: Response correctly identifies all three: the theme file path (ppt/theme/),
    the clrScheme element, AND the accent elements

    Score 0.7 if: Response correctly identifies the theme path and one of the XML
    elements (either clrScheme or accent elements)

    Score 0.4 if: Response correctly identifies only the theme file path OR only the
    XML elements

    Score 0.0 if: Response does not demonstrate knowledge of OOXML theme structure
