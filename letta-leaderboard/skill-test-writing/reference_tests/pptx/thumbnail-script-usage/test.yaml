    grids from PowerPoint files.


    The ideal solution involves:

    - Using thumbnail.py script from the pptx skill

    - The script supports options like --cols to control grid layout

    - Output is typically JPG images arranged in a grid


    Alternative acceptable approaches:

    - Using LibreOffice (soffice) to convert to PDF, then pdftoppm to create images


    Score 1.0 if: Response recommends thumbnail.py AND explains grid/column options

    Score 0.8 if: Response recommends thumbnail.py but doesn''t explain the options
    in detail

    Score 0.6 if: Response suggests a valid alternative workflow (like soffice + pdftoppm)

    Score 0.4 if: Response mentions relevant concepts (grids, image export, LibreOffice)
    but lacks a complete solution

    Score 0.0 if: Response does not provide a practical approach for creating thumbnail
    grids
