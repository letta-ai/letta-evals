  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly explains the inventory JSON structure
    for PowerPoint text extraction.


    Key aspects of the inventory JSON format:

    - Slides are identified with keys like "slide-0", "slide-1", etc. (0-indexed)

    - Shapes within slides use keys like "shape-0", "shape-1", etc.

    - Each shape has a "paragraphs" array containing the text content

    - Shapes may include placeholder_type (TITLE, BODY, SUBTITLE, etc.)

    - Position properties (left, top, width, height) may be included


    Score 1.0 if: Response correctly explains both slide naming (slide-0, slide-1)
    AND shape naming (shape-0, shape-1) conventions with JSON structure context

    Score 0.8 if: Response explains the naming conventions and shows JSON structure

    Score 0.6 if: Response explains one naming convention with additional context
    (paragraphs or placeholders)

    Score 0.4 if: Response mentions slide/shape naming OR placeholder types but lacks
    complete structure

    Score 0.0 if: Response does not demonstrate knowledge of the inventory JSON format
