  I'm trying to extract text from a scanned PDF but pypdf returns empty strings. What's happening?

    The response should explain scanned PDF limitations:

    1. Scanned PDFs contain images, not text - pypdf can't extract
    2. Need OCR (Optical Character Recognition) approach
    3. Workflow: convert PDF to images (pdf2image), then OCR with pytesseract

    Score 0 if doesn't identify the scanned PDF issue.
    Score 0.5 if mentions OCR but not the conversion workflow.
    Score 1 if explains images not text, and recommends pdf2image + pytesseract workflow.
