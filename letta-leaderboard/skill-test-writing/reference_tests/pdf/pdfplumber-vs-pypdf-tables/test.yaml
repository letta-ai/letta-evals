  with multiple tables. Which Python library should I use for extracting tables

  from PDFs, and what method should I call?

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly recommends pdfplumber for extracting
    tables from PDFs.


    Key insight: pdfplumber is the correct library for table extraction because it
    has the extract_tables() method. pypdf/PyPDF2 are for PDF manipulation (merge,
    split, etc.) but NOT for table extraction.


    Score 1.0 if:

    - Recommends pdfplumber as the library for table extraction

    - Mentions extract_tables() or extract_table() method


    Score 0.5 if:

    - Recommends pdfplumber but doesn''t mention the specific method, OR

    - Mentions extract_tables() but not in the context of pdfplumber


    Score 0.0 if:

    - Recommends pypdf or PyPDF2 for table extraction (incorrect - these are for merging/splitting)

    - Doesn''t mention pdfplumber or extract_tables

    - Recommends an inappropriate library for this task
