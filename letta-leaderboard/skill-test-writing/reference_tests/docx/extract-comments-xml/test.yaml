  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly explains where comments are stored
    in the OOXML structure of a .docx file.


    The correct answer is:

    - Comments are stored in word/comments.xml within the .docx (ZIP) archive

    - The main document (document.xml) references comments via IDs (using elements
    like w:comment)

    - Understanding this requires knowledge that .docx is an OOXML (ZIP-based) format


    Score 1.0 if: Response correctly identifies comments.xml (or word/comments.xml)
    as the location AND explains how comments are referenced from document.xml using
    comment IDs or w:comment elements.


    Score 0.8 if: Response correctly identifies comments.xml as the location AND shows
    understanding of OOXML structure (ZIP-based format, unpacking, etc.).


    Score 0.6 if: Response correctly identifies comments.xml as the location for storing
    comments.


    Score 0.4 if: Response demonstrates general understanding of OOXML/XML structure
    in relation to comments but doesn''t pinpoint comments.xml specifically.


    Score 0.0 if: Response does not demonstrate understanding of where comments are
    stored in OOXML structure.
