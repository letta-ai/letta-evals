  In DOCX, when do I use pPr (paragraph properties) vs rPr (run properties) for formatting?

    The response should explain the scope of each:

    1. pPr = paragraph-level: alignment, spacing, indentation, bullets
    2. rPr = run/character-level: bold, italic, font size, color
    3. A paragraph can have multiple runs with different rPr

    Score 0 if confuses the two or doesn't explain the difference.
    Score 0.5 if partially correct but missing key distinction.
    Score 1 if correctly explains pPr is paragraph-level, rPr is character/run-level.
