  My Playwright test fails with "connection refused" even though I started the server. What's happening?
timeout: 120

    The response should identify the server startup race condition:

    1. Server startup is async - takes time to bind to port
    2. Test runs before server is ready to accept connections
    3. Need to wait for server to be ready (port check, health endpoint, or helper script)

    Score 0 if doesn't identify timing/race condition issue.
    Score 0.5 if mentions timing but no concrete solution.
    Score 1 if explains the race condition and suggests waiting for server readiness.
