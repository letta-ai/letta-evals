  Node.js frontend dev server together. How do I set this up with Playwright?

    testing with Playwright.


    The key pattern is using a with_server.py helper script that can orchestrate multiple
    servers (e.g., Python backend + Node.js frontend) for integration testing. The
    script handles starting both servers, waiting for them to be ready, and running
    Playwright tests.


    Score 1.0 if: Response mentions with_server.py AND shows multiple --server flags
    AND addresses both Python backend and Node.js/npm frontend servers

    Score 0.8 if: Response uses with_server.py and addresses running multiple servers
    or both server types

    Score 0.6 if: Response mentions with_server.py with directory changes or port
    configuration

    Score 0.4 if: Response mentions with_server.py OR shows understanding of running
    both server types together

    Score 0.0 if: Response doesn''t address the multi-server orchestration pattern
