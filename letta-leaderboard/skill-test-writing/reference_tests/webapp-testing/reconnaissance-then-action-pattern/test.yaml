    The response should describe the reconnaissance-then-action pattern:

    1. First navigate and wait for networkidle
    2. Then inspect rendered DOM (screenshot, page.content(), locator.all())
    3. Identify selectors from the actual rendered state
    4. Only then execute actions with discovered selectors

    Score 0 if suggests guessing selectors or reading source code only.
    Score 0.5 if mentions inspection but not the full workflow.
    Score 1 if describes: navigate -> wait -> inspect rendered state -> identify selectors -> act.
