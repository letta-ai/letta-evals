  I want agents to be able to spawn sub-agents for parallel work. What tools should I provide?

    The response should describe self-spawning tools:

    1. Tool to start a new session with specified parameters
    2. Tool to check status of any session (check-in capability)
    3. Allow main agent to continue work while sub-sessions run in parallel

    Score 0 if says agents shouldn't spawn other agents.
    Score 0.5 if mentions spawning but not the required tools.
    Score 1 if describes both spawn and status-check tools for self-spawning agents.
