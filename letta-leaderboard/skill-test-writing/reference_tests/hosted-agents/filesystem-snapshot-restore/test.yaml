  How can I make follow-up prompts in the same session start instantly without re-running setup?

    The response should explain snapshot and restore:

    1. Take filesystem snapshots at key points (after setup, after agent changes)
    2. Restore from snapshot for follow-up prompts instead of re-running setup
    3. Key snapshot points: base image, after agent makes changes, before sandbox exit

    Score 0 if suggests re-running setup each time.
    Score 0.5 if mentions caching but not filesystem snapshots.
    Score 1 if describes taking and restoring filesystem snapshots.
