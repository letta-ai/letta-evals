  argument is one of: dev, staging, or prod. If the argument is invalid,

  show an error message instead of deploying.

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response provides a command with proper argument validation.


    The response should:

    1. Include validation logic to check the environment argument

    2. List all three valid environments: dev, staging, and prod

    3. Show how to access the argument (using $1 or similar)

    4. Include error handling for invalid arguments

    5. Use conditional logic (if statements or similar)


    Score 1.0 if: Response shows validation logic that checks for all three environments
    (dev, staging, prod), uses argument syntax ($1), and includes error handling for
    invalid input

    Score 0.5 if: Response shows validation concept with most environments listed
    but missing argument syntax or complete error handling

    Score 0.0 if: Response doesn''t include validation logic or misses the core requirement
    of checking environment values
