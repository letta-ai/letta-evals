  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response demonstrates knowledge of the @ syntax for
    file references in Claude Code commands.


    The response should:

    1. Show the @ syntax for referencing files (e.g., @path/to/file, @$1, @package.json)

    2. Explain that the file contents are included/injected into the command

    3. Ideally show a concrete example


    Score 1.0 if: Response shows the @ syntax with a concrete example (like @$1, @src/file.ts,
    @package.json) and explains that file contents are included

    Score 0.5 if: Response mentions @ syntax but lacks a clear example or explanation
    of content inclusion

    Score 0.0 if: Response doesn''t show the @ syntax for file references
