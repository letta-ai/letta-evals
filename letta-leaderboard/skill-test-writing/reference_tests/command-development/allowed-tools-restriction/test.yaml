    frontmatter for restricting tool access in Claude Code commands.


    The response should:

    1. Mention the allowed-tools frontmatter field

    2. Show the Bash(git:*) or similar pattern for restricting to git commands

    3. Show it in frontmatter context (between --- delimiters)


    Score 1.0 if: Response shows allowed-tools in frontmatter with a Bash(git:*) or
    similar pattern that restricts to git commands

    Score 0.5 if: Response mentions allowed-tools but doesn''t show the specific pattern
    for restricting to git commands

    Score 0.0 if: Response doesn''t mention allowed-tools or gives an incorrect method
    for tool restriction
