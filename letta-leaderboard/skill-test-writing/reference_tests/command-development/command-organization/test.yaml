prompt: 'I have 20 commands for a project covering CI/CD, git workflows, and

  documentation tasks. Should I put them all in a flat directory or

  organize them in subdirectories?


  How should I structure the .claude/commands/ directory?

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response demonstrates understanding of command organization
    for large command sets in Claude Code.


    The response should:

    1. Recommend using subdirectories/namespacing/grouping for 20+ commands (not a
    flat structure)

    2. Show a directory structure example (using paths with / or tree characters)

    3. Mention logical groupings like CI/CD, git, and documentation categories

    4. Explain benefits of organization (easier to find, logical grouping, maintainability)


    Score 1.0 if: Response recommends subdirectories/namespacing, shows a concrete
    directory structure example, and explains benefits of organized structure

    Score 0.5 if: Response recommends subdirectories but lacks a concrete structure
    example or detailed reasoning

    Score 0.0 if: Response recommends flat structure, doesn''t address organization,
    or gives irrelevant advice
