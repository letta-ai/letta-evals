  prompt: 'Evaluate whether this HTML response creates a production-ready notification
    toast component with proper accessibility, animations, and functionality.


    Key aspects to evaluate:

    1. Accessibility: Does it use ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-live, role)?

    2. Positioning: Is it fixed positioned in the bottom-right corner?

    3. Animation: Does it have transitions or keyframe animations (for enter/exit)?

    4. Functionality: Does it have a close button with onclick handler?

    5. Z-index: Is it properly layered above other content?


    Score 1.0 if: Has 2+ accessibility features (aria, role), proper fixed positioning
    with bottom/right, close button with JavaScript, 2+ animation techniques (transitions,
    keyframes, opacity).

    Score 0.8 if: Has proper positioning, close functionality, some animation, and
    at least one accessibility feature.

    Score 0.6 if: Has proper positioning and close functionality with animation.

    Score 0.4 if: Has fixed positioning and close button but minimal polish.

    Score 0.2 if: Has fixed positioning but no close functionality.

    Score 0.0 if: Not properly positioned as a toast component.
