    color scheme for a productivity dashboard, avoiding generic "AI slop" aesthetics.


    Key aspects to evaluate:

    1. Does it avoid the cliche purple gradient on white background combination?

    2. Does it use CSS variables (custom properties with --) for color management?

    3. Does it have a cohesive color palette with multiple coordinated colors?

    4. Are the color choices intentional and distinctive rather than generic defaults?


    Score 1.0 if: Uses CSS variables for theming (3+ color variables), avoids purple
    gradient on white, demonstrates thoughtful color variety with a cohesive palette.

    Score 0.8 if: Uses gradients and accent colors creatively without CSS variables,
    avoids the generic purple/white combo.

    Score 0.6 if: Has good color variety (5+ distinct colors) but may lack CSS variables
    or sophisticated theming.

    Score 0.4 if: Shows some effort with colors but falls into generic patterns.

    Score 0.2 if: Uses the generic purple gradient on white background combination.

    Score 0.0 if: Minimal color styling or completely generic approach.
