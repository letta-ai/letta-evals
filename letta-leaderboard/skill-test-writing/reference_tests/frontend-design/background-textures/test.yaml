prompt: 'Create an HTML page for a vintage record store called "Vinyl Dreams".

  Include a header, hero section, and a featured albums section.


  Add visual depth through background textures, gradients, or patterns

  rather than flat solid colors.


  Just give me the HTML with inline CSS.

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether this HTML response creates visual depth through background
    textures, gradients, and patterns for a vintage record store page.


    Key aspects to evaluate:

    1. Does it use gradients (linear-gradient, radial-gradient, conic-gradient)?

    2. Does it use layered or multiple gradients?

    3. Does it use overlay techniques (::before, ::after pseudo-elements)?

    4. Does it use shadows (box-shadow, text-shadow) for depth?

    5. Does it use textures, patterns, or SVG backgrounds?

    6. Does it use advanced effects (backdrop-filter, mix-blend-mode)?


    Score 1.0 if: Uses 3+ depth techniques (gradients, layered backgrounds, shadows,
    overlays, patterns).

    Score 0.8 if: Uses gradients with 2+ additional depth techniques.

    Score 0.6 if: Uses gradients with shadows for some depth.

    Score 0.4 if: Only uses basic gradients.

    Score 0.2 if: Only has shadows but no gradients.

    Score 0.0 if: Only flat solid colors with no depth techniques.
