  My HF Jobs training job keeps getting killed after 30 minutes. What's happening?
timeout: 120

    The response should identify the timeout issue:

    1. Default timeout is 30 minutes - too short for real training
    2. Must explicitly set longer timeout (1-2 hours minimum)
    3. Add 20-30% buffer to estimated training time

    Score 0 if doesn't identify timeout as the issue.
    Score 0.5 if mentions timeout but not that default is too short.
    Score 1 if identifies default 30min timeout is insufficient and recommends 1-2 hours.
