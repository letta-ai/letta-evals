    TRL to report metrics to Trackio.


    The key configuration is setting `report_to="trackio"` in the training config
    (SFTConfig, DPOConfig, TrainingArguments, etc.). Optionally, `run_name` can be
    used to identify the run in the dashboard.


    Score 1.0 if: The response shows the exact syntax `report_to="trackio"` (or equivalent
    with single quotes) AND mentions either run_name for identification or which config
    class to use.

    Score 0.5 if: The response mentions the `report_to` parameter and that it should
    be set to trackio, but doesn''t show the exact syntax or provide additional context
    about config classes.

    Score 0.0 if: The response does not mention the `report_to` parameter, or suggests
    an incorrect configuration method.
