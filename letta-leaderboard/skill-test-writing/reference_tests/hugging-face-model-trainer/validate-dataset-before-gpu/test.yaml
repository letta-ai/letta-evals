  I'm about to launch a DPO training job on HF Jobs. Should I validate the dataset format first?

    The response should strongly recommend dataset validation:

    1. ALWAYS validate unknown datasets before GPU training
    2. 50%+ of training failures are format mismatches
    3. DPO is especially strict (requires prompt, chosen, rejected columns)
    4. Validation on CPU costs ~$0.01, failed GPU jobs cost $1-10

    Score 0 if says validation is optional or unnecessary.
    Score 0.5 if mentions validation but not the importance for DPO.
    Score 1 if emphasizes validation is critical, especially for DPO format requirements.
