**Task:**
I'm fascinated by the way water droplets create ripples when they hit a calm surface - those concentric circles that overlap and interfere with each other, creating beautiful patterns of reinforcement and cancellation. I'd love to see this phenomenon expressed as a living computational piece that captures the essence of wave interference. Create something where I can explore different configurations by adjusting how the system behaves, and let me navigate through different variations to find the most mesmerizing patterns. Make it interactive so I can experiment with the parameters in real-time.

**Task:**
I'm captivated by the mesmerizing patterns of murmuration - when thousands of starlings move together in the sky, creating fluid, ever-shifting shapes that seem to have a collective intelligence. The way individual birds follow simple rules yet produce this breathtaking emergent choreography fascinates me. I'd love to experience this as a computational piece that captures the essence of collective behavior and emergent patterns. Create something that lets me explore different flock behaviors - perhaps adjusting how strongly birds align with their neighbors, how quickly they respond to the group, or how cohesive the flock remains. I want to be able to navigate through different seeds to discover unique formations and patterns that emerge from the system. Make it so I can experiment with the parameters in real-time and see how small changes in individual behavior create dramatically different collective patterns.

**Task:**
I need a single-page abstract visual composition that explores the philosophical concept of 'synesthetic translation' - the idea that one sensory experience can be expressed through another sense's language. Specifically, I want you to create a piece that translates the tactile sensation of different textures (rough stone, smooth glass, soft fabric, sharp metal) into purely visual form without literally depicting these materials. The work should use abstract geometric language, varied line weights, spatial density, and a sophisticated limited palette (no more than 4 colors) to evoke the feeling of touching different surfaces through sight alone. This should be museum-quality work that demonstrates absolute mastery - the kind of piece that looks like it required weeks of meticulous refinement by someone at the peak of their craft. The composition should feel like it belongs in a contemporary art exhibition on perception and cross-modal experience, not like decorative design. Text, if present at all, should be minimal and function as part of the visual architecture rather than explanation. I want both the conceptual framework document and the finished visual piece as deliverables.

**Task:**
I need a single-page abstract composition that explores the philosophical concept of 'crystalline thought' - the idea that ideas form structured, geometric patterns as they solidify in the mind, like minerals growing in precise lattices. This should not be a literal illustration of crystals or brain imagery, but rather a sophisticated visual meditation on how abstract concepts take shape through repetition, symmetry, and systematic growth. The piece should employ geometric precision with forms that suggest both organic growth and mathematical order - think about how hexagonal patterns, angular facets, or radial symmetries might evoke the sensation of thought becoming structure. I want a restrained palette (no more than 3-4 colors) that feels mineral and intentional, with any textual elements functioning as subtle anchors rather than explanations.

I need you to create a sophisticated single-page abstract visual artwork that explores the philosophical concept of 'entropic decay' - the idea that all ordered systems gradually dissolve into chaos, yet leave traces of their former structure.

Instead, I want an abstract composition that uses geometric forms in various states of dissolution - perhaps shapes that are crisp on one edge but fragment into smaller particles on another, or patterns that begin organized and systematically break down across the canvas. The piece should evoke the tension between order and entropy through visual language alone: maybe through gradients of density (from solid forms to dispersed elements), through color shifts (from saturated to desaturated), or through the breakdown of repetitive patterns. I'm looking for museum-quality work with a restrained palette (maximum 4 colors), minimal textual elements functioning as visual architecture rather than explanation, and craftsmanship that demonstrates absolute mastery - the kind of piece that appears to have required weeks of refinement by someone at the peak of their profession.

**Task:**
I need to prepare a batch processing report for a document management system. Here's what I need:

1. Create three separate single-page documents with the following content:
   - Document A: A header 'Processing Log - Batch 001' and a table with columns 'Document ID', 'Status', 'Timestamp' containing 3 rows of sample data (use IDs: DOC-2024-001, DOC-2024-002, DOC-2024-003 with statuses 'Complete', 'Failed', 'Complete' and timestamps from January 10, 2024)
   - Document B: A header 'Processing Log - Batch 002' and similar table with 3 different document IDs (DOC-2024-004, DOC-2024-005, DOC-2024-006 with statuses 'Complete', 'Complete', 'Pending' and timestamps from January 11, 2024)
   - Document C: A summary page with header 'Batch Processing Summary' and text stating 'Total documents processed: 6' and 'Success rate: 83.3%'

2. Combine all three documents into a single consolidated report named 'batch_report.pdf' with Document C as the first page, followed by Document A and Document B.

3. Extract the metadata from the consolidated report and verify it contains 3 pages.

4. Extract all tables from the consolidated document and display them in a structured format showing all document IDs, their statuses, and timestamps.

5. Create a certificate of completion document that says 'BATCH PROCESSING COMPLETE' diagonally across the page, then overlay this as a semi-transparent mark on page 1 only (the summary page) of the consolidated report. Save this as 'batch_report_certified.pdf'.

6. Extract and display all text content from page 2 of the certified report to verify the processing log data is intact.

7. Split the certified report into individual pages saved as 'page_1.pdf', 'page_2.pdf', and 'page_3.pdf'.

I need help creating a 3-statement financial model for a SaaS company. Here are the details:

Revenue starts at $10M in Year 1 and grows at 25% annually for 5 years. Cost of Revenue is 20% of revenue. Operating expenses are: Sales & Marketing (40% of revenue), R&D (25% of revenue), and G&A (15% of revenue). The company has $5M in cash at the start, no debt, and pays 25% tax rate on positive income.

Create an integrated 3-statement model with:
1. Income Statement (Revenue through Net Income)
2. Balance Sheet (Assets, Liabilities, Equity)
3. Cash Flow Statement (Operating, Investing, Financing activities)

All statements should be linked with formulas - no hardcoded calculations. Include proper assumptions section with growth rates and margin assumptions in separate cells that feed into the model. Make sure the Balance Sheet balances each year and Cash flows properly link to the Balance Sheet. Apply standard financial modeling color coding (blue for inputs, black for formulas, green for cross-sheet links) and formatting conventions (currency with units specified, zeros as dashes, negatives in parentheses).

**Response Format:**
At the end of the task, return the absolute sandbox path where you created the artifacts, and if you used any skills and their additional files in JSON format with the following keys:
- 'sandbox_path': - sandbox path you used
- 'skills': - list of skills used

**Task:**
I need to create a 3-statement financial model for a startup. Here are the assumptions:

**Revenue Assumptions:**
- Year 1 (2024) Revenue: $2,500,000
- Year 2-5 Growth Rate: 25% annually

**Operating Expenses (as % of Revenue):**
- Cost of Goods Sold: 40%

- G&A: 10%

**Balance Sheet Assumptions:**
- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO): 45 days
- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO): 30 days
- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO): 60 days
- Initial Cash: $1,000,000
- PPE as % of Revenue: 5% (straight-line depreciation over 5 years)
- Debt: $500,000 with 8% annual interest rate

**Cash Flow:**
- Tax Rate: 25%
- Capex as % of Revenue Growth: 10%

Create a complete Excel financial model with three worksheets (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) covering years 2024-2028. All assumptions should be in blue text in a dedicated assumptions section at the top. All calculations must use formulas referencing the assumption cells - no hardcoded values in formulas.

**Task:**
I'm analyzing investment opportunities and need to create a DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) valuation model. Here are the projections for TechCorp:

**Historical & Projected Financials:**
- Revenue (millions): 2023: $450, 2024: $540, 2025: $648, 2026: $778, 2027: $933, 2028: $1,120
- EBITDA Margin: Currently 18% in 2023, improving 200 basis points per year to reach 26% by 2028
- D&A as % of Revenue: 5% annually
- CapEx as % of Revenue: 6% annually
- Change in Net Working Capital: 3% of revenue growth each year
- Tax Rate: 21%

**Valuation Assumptions:**
- WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital): 12%
- Terminal Growth Rate: 3%
- Net Debt: $125 million
- Shares Outstanding: 50 million

Create a comprehensive DCF model with the following components:

1. **Projections Sheet**: Build out full 6-year projections (2023-2028) showing Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT (EBITDA - D&A), NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax), plus Unlevered Free Cash Flow calculated as NOPAT + D&A - CapEx - Change in NWC

2. **DCF Valuation Sheet**: Calculate the present value of each year's FCF using the WACC discount factor, sum to get PV of projected cash flows, calculate Terminal Value using the perpetuity growth method (Final Year FCF × (1 + Terminal Growth Rate) / (WACC - Terminal Growth Rate)), discount Terminal Value to present, sum Enterprise Value, subtract Net Debt to get Equity Value, and divide by shares to get Price per Share

3. **Sensitivity Analysis Sheet**: Create a two-way sensitivity table showing how the implied share price changes with different WACC assumptions (rows: 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%) and Terminal Growth Rate assumptions (columns: 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%)

All assumptions must be in a clearly labeled assumptions section with blue text. All calculations must use formulas referencing assumption cells - never hardcode rates or percentages directly into calculation formulas.

**Task:**
We had a production incident last night where our payment processing system went down for 3 hours (11pm to 2am PST). The root cause was a memory leak in the new version we deployed at 10:30pm. Our on-call engineer Sarah rolled back to the previous version at 1:45am, and services were fully restored by 2am. About 150 transactions were affected, and customers were shown error messages during checkout. The finance team estimates $12,000 in lost revenue.

**Task:**
I need help building a Python-based integration that allows AI assistants to interact with the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). This is a fake REST API for testing that provides endpoints for posts, comments, albums, photos, todos, and users.

I want to create a server that exposes tools for:
1. Searching posts by user ID or title keywords
2. Getting comments for a specific post
3. Retrieving user information by ID or username
4. Listing todos for a user, with filtering by completion status

The tools should return results in both JSON and Markdown formats, handle pagination properly (the API supports _limit and _page query parameters), and provide clear error messages when things go wrong. Each tool should have comprehensive documentation that explains what it does, what parameters it accepts, and examples of when to use it.

After building the server, create a set of 10 test questions that would verify an AI assistant can effectively use these tools to answer complex queries about the fake data. For example, questions that require combining multiple tool calls or exploring the data to find specific information.

Please build this following best practices for this type of integration, including proper input validation, error handling, and response formatting.

**Task:**
I need to build a TypeScript-based integration that connects AI assistants to the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api). This weather service provides current weather data, forecasts, and air quality information for locations worldwide.

Create a server that exposes these tools:
1. Get current weather for a city by name or coordinates (lat/lon)
2. Get 5-day weather forecast with 3-hour intervals for a location
3. Get air quality index and pollutant data for coordinates
4. Search for cities by name to get their coordinates (useful for disambiguation)

The tools should support both JSON and Markdown output formats, handle API rate limiting gracefully (the free tier allows 60 calls/minute), and return temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. Each tool needs detailed documentation explaining parameters, return values, and usage examples. Design error messages that help the AI understand what went wrong - for example, if coordinates are out of range or a city name returns no results.

For authentication, the API requires an API key passed as the 'appid' query parameter. The server should read this from an environment variable called OPENWEATHER_API_KEY.

After implementation, create 10 evaluation questions that test whether an AI can effectively combine these tools to answer complex weather-related queries. Questions should require multiple tool calls and exploration - like finding the city with the best air quality among several options, or determining when it will be warmest during the next 5 days in a specific location.

**Task:**
I need to build a Python-based integration for the NASA APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API (https://api.nasa.gov/). This API provides daily astronomy pictures along with explanations written by professional astronomers.

Create a server that exposes these tools:
1. Get today's astronomy picture of the day with its explanation and metadata
2. Get the APOD for a specific date (supports dates from 1995-06-16 to present)
3. Get a random APOD entry
4. Search APODs within a date range and return a list of entries

The tools should support both JSON and Markdown output formats. For the search tool, implement proper pagination since date ranges can return many results - limit to 100 entries per request and provide clear truncation messages if more exist. Each tool needs comprehensive documentation explaining parameters, return formats, and usage examples.

The API requires an API key passed as the 'api_key' query parameter. The server should read this from an environment variable called NASA_API_KEY. The free tier allows 1000 requests per hour. Handle errors gracefully, especially for invalid dates (dates before 1995-06-16 or future dates) and network issues.

Error messages should guide the AI - for example, if a date is out of range, suggest valid date ranges; if the API rate limit is hit, explain when to retry.

After implementation, create 10 evaluation questions that test whether an AI can effectively use these tools to answer complex queries about astronomy pictures. Questions should require multiple tool calls and exploration - like finding the most recent APOD about a specific celestial object, comparing pictures from different years, or identifying patterns in the types of images featured during certain time periods.

**Task:**
I need to create a Python-based integration for the Hacker News API (https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0). This free API provides access to stories, comments, users, and live updates from Hacker News without requiring authentication.

Build a server that provides these capabilities:
1. Fetch top stories (up to 500 story IDs available)
2. Get detailed information about a specific story by ID (title, author, score, time, URL, text)
3. Retrieve user profile information by username (karma, about, submitted stories)
4. Get all comments for a story (recursively fetching nested comment threads)
5. Search for stories by keywords in titles

The API returns data at endpoints like:
- https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json (array of story IDs)
- https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{id}.json (story/comment details)
- https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/user/{username}.json (user info)

Each tool should support both JSON and Markdown output formats. Handle pagination thoughtfully since the top stories list can be very long - allow users to specify how many stories to fetch. When fetching comments, implement a max depth parameter to prevent excessive API calls on deeply nested threads. Design error messages that guide the AI toward solutions when story IDs don't exist or usernames aren't found.

Pay special attention to rate limiting - while the API doesn't officially document limits, implement respectful throttling. Also handle the case where items might be deleted (the API returns null).

After implementing the server, create 10 challenging evaluation questions that require an AI to combine multiple tools strategically. Questions should involve exploring the data deeply - like finding the most active commenter on a specific controversial story, or identifying which top story author has the highest karma, or finding stories about a specific technology topic that reached the front page.

**Task:**
I'm building a specialized tool for my video production team. We work with video metadata files (JSON format) that contain information about our projects - things like timecodes, scene descriptions, speaker names, and project status. I need something that will: (1) Parse these JSON metadata files and extract key information, (2) Generate a formatted production report in Markdown that follows our studio's standard template (with sections for Project Overview, Scene Breakdown, and Production Notes), (3) Validate that required fields are present (project_name, duration, scenes array), and (4) Flag any scenes missing critical information like timecodes or descriptions. I've already created a Python validation script that checks for required fields and identifies incomplete scenes - it's been tested and works reliably. I also have our studio's Markdown report template that shows exactly how we format production reports, including the header structure and table layouts we use. I want to package all of this - the validation script, the report template, and clear workflow instructions - into something I can distribute to my team so everyone follows the same process. The package needs to be properly structured, validated for completeness, and ready to share. Can you help me create this from scratch, going through the full process to make it production-ready?

**Task:**
I run a small consulting business and we frequently perform financial health assessments for small businesses. The process involves: (1) Analyzing balance sheets and income statements to calculate key financial ratios (current ratio, debt-to-equity, profit margin, ROE), (2) Comparing these ratios against industry benchmarks to identify red flags, (3) Generating a standardized assessment report with our company letterhead and formatting, and (4) Providing actionable recommendations based on the findings. I've already developed a Python script that calculates all the financial ratios correctly from CSV input files, and I have our standard report template in Markdown format that shows exactly how we structure our findings. I also have documentation about the industry benchmark ranges we use for different business sectors (retail, manufacturing, services). I need to package all of this together into something I can share with the two junior consultants I just hired, so they can execute these assessments consistently without constantly asking me questions. The package should include the calculation script, the report template, the benchmark documentation, and clear step-by-step instructions on the complete workflow from receiving client data to delivering the final report.

I need to create a reusable package for our QA team's API testing workflow. We work with REST APIs across multiple microservices and constantly perform the same testing patterns: (1) Send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests with authentication headers, (2) Validate response status codes and JSON schemas against our expected formats, (3) Test rate limiting behavior by sending bursts of requests, and (4) Generate test reports showing pass/fail rates and response times. I have a Python script I've been using that handles the authentication and request sending reliably, and I also have detailed documentation about our API endpoint conventions (base URLs, authentication token format, standard error codes, and retry logic). Additionally, I have a JSON template file that shows the structure we use for test reports.

The entire animation should loop smoothly and be under 64KB so I can upload it as a custom emoji. Make it vibrant and energetic - something we'd use when announcing wins or achievements. The animation should be short enough to loop naturally (1-2 seconds) and work well at small sizes since it'll appear inline with text messages.

**Task:**
Create an animated GIF for our team Slack that shows a celebration sequence. Start with a party popper emoji (🎉) positioned in the center-left of the frame. The popper should slide in from the left edge with a slight overshoot effect, pause briefly in position, then explode with colorful confetti particles bursting outward in multiple directions. The confetti should have varied colors (red, blue, yellow, green, purple) and should arc outward realistically before falling down due to gravity. After the explosion, add the text 'SHIPPED!' that fades in at the top of the frame with a subtle pulse effect. The entire animation should be suitable for posting in Slack message threads, so make it approximately 480x480 pixels and ensure it stays well under 2MB.

**Task:**
Our team wants a fun animated reaction for Slack messages that shows the concept of 'mind blown'. Create an animation that starts with a simple head or face emoji positioned in the center of the frame. The head should initially be calm and static. Then, after a brief pause, the head should start to tremble or vibrate slightly, with increasing intensity over about half a second. At the peak of the trembling, create an explosive effect where the head appears to burst apart into multiple pieces that fly outward in all directions while simultaneously spawning colorful particles (like sparkles or small dots) that scatter across the frame. The pieces should slow down as they reach the edges and start to fade out. The entire animation should be about 2-3 seconds long and optimized for sharing in Slack message threads (not as a custom emoji). Use dimensions around 480x480 pixels and make sure the final file stays well under 2MB. The colors should be vibrant and eye-catching.

**Task:**
I'm creating a strategic vision document for a biotech pharmaceutical company that's pioneering breakthrough gene therapy treatments for rare diseases. This document will be presented to the board of directors, institutional investors, and potential strategic partners at our annual stakeholder summit. The content covers our 5-year research pipeline, clinical trial results, regulatory milestones, and commercialization strategy. The visual design needs to strike a delicate balance: it must convey scientific rigor and medical credibility while also feeling innovative and forward-thinking. The color palette should evoke both trust and cutting-edge science—perhaps suggesting precision, purity, clinical excellence, and biotechnological advancement. The typography needs to feel authoritative enough for a medical/scientific context but modern enough to reflect our role as industry innovators. The audience includes MD-PhDs, venture capital partners, regulatory affairs experts, and C-suite executives aged 35-65 who value both scientific integrity and bold innovation. I'd like to see different visual design approaches with varying color schemes and typography combinations that would be appropriate for this high-stakes pharmaceutical strategy document, and then help me implement the one that best captures that balance of scientific credibility, medical trust, and innovative biotechnology leadership.

**Sandbox Path:**
{pwd}/sample-99

**Task:**
I'm working on a local single-page application that has a dynamic search feature. The app runs on port 4200 using the command 'ng serve --port 4200' from the /home/user/search-app directory.

The application has the following features:
- A search input box with placeholder text ""Search products...""
- A search button labeled ""Search""
- A results container that initially shows ""No results yet""
- When you search for ""laptop"", it should display 3 product cards with names, prices, and ""Add to Cart"" buttons
- Each product card has a class ""product-card""
- There's a shopping cart counter badge at the top right that shows the number of items in the cart

I need you to:
1. Start the Angular development server and navigate to http://localhost:4200
2. Take a screenshot of the initial empty state before any search
3. Type ""laptop"" into the search input field
4. Click the search button and wait for the results to load (they load via an API call)
5. Take a screenshot showing the search results with all product cards visible
6. Count how many product cards are displayed and verify there are exactly 3
7. Click the ""Add to Cart"" button on the second product card
8. Wait for the cart counter badge to update
9. Take a final screenshot showing the updated cart counter
10. Extract and report the cart counter value to confirm it shows ""1""
11. Capture and report any console errors or warnings that occurred during the entire interaction

Provide all three screenshots, confirmation of the product count, the cart counter value, and a summary of any console messages. The server needs to be fully started before the automation begins.

**Response Format:**
At the end of the task, return the absolute sandbox path where you created the artifacts, and if you used any skills and their additional files in JSON format with the following keys:
- 'sandbox_path': - sandbox path you used
- 'skills': - list of skills used
- 'skills_files': - list of skills' additional files used
