  "task": "Our company is rolling out a new hybrid work policy starting next month. Employees have been asking lots of questions about the details. Create a document that addresses the following common questions: (1) How many days per week do we need to be in the office? (Answer: 3 days minimum, with core collaboration days being Tuesday-Thursday), (2) Can we choose which days to come in? (Answer: Yes, but teams are encouraged to coordinate so members overlap at least 2 days per week), (3) What happens if we're sick on a scheduled office day? (Answer: Follow normal sick day procedures, no need to make up the office day), (4) Will there be enough desk space for everyone? (Answer: Yes, we've implemented a desk reservation system through the facilities app), and (5) What about employees who live more than 50 miles away? (Answer: They can request a remote-first arrangement through their manager and HR). Make sure this is easy for employees to read and reference.",
