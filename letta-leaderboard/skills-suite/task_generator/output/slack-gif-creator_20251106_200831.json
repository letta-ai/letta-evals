  "task": "Create an animated GIF for our team's Slack workspace showing a notification alert concept. The animation should start with a small bell icon in the center that gradually increases in brightness and size (like it's calling for attention). Then the bell should ring back and forth 3-4 times with realistic swing motion - swinging left, then right, then left again with decreasing intensity like a real bell losing momentum. While the bell is ringing, add small circular ripple effects that emanate outward from the bell to emphasize the sound waves. After the ringing stops, have the bell pulse once more and then return to its original size. The entire animation should be about 2-3 seconds long. This will be used as a regular message GIF (not a custom emoji), so make it 480x480 pixels and ensure it stays well under 2MB. Use a clean, professional color scheme - the bell could be gold/yellow and the ripples could be semi-transparent waves. Make sure the animation loops seamlessly and verify the final file meets Slack's requirements for message GIFs.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The GIF shows a bell icon that increases in brightness and size at the beginning of the animation\n2. The bell demonstrates realistic swing/ringing motion with 3-4 swings that decrease in intensity, and circular ripple effects emanate from the bell during the ringing phase\n3. The animation is approximately 2-3 seconds long, uses 480x480 dimensions, and the final file size is verified to be under 2MB for Slack message GIF requirements\n4. The animation loops seamlessly with appropriate color scheme (gold/yellow bell with semi-transparent ripple waves) and ends with a final pulse before looping",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The slack-gif-creator skill is identified and selected as the appropriate skill for creating an animated GIF for Slack\n2. The SKILL.md file from the slack-gif-creator skill is loaded to understand the toolkit structure, validators, and animation primitives\n3. Multiple additional files are loaded and used appropriately, including core modules (gif_builder.py, validators.py, easing.py, visual_effects.py, frame_composer.py) and relevant template files for animations (such as pulse.py, wiggle.py or shake.py for the swinging motion)\n4. The skill components are used appropriately: GIFBuilder is used to assemble frames at correct dimensions and FPS, easing functions are applied for smooth motion (brightness increase, size scaling, swing momentum decay), visual effects are used for ripple creation, validators confirm the final GIF meets Slack's message GIF requirements (<2MB, 480x480), and animation primitives are composed together to achieve the complex multi-phase animation",
