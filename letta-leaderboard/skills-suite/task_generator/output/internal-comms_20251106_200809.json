  "task": "Our company is launching a new hybrid work policy starting next month. Employees have been asking lots of questions in various channels. Write responses to these three frequently asked questions: (1) Will I need manager approval to work from home on specific days, or can I choose my own schedule? (2) How many days per week are we required to be in the office? (3) What happens if I live more than 50 miles from an office location? Make sure the answers are clear, consistent in tone, and address employee concerns while reinforcing the policy that requires 3 days in-office for employees within commuting distance, allows flexible scheduling without pre-approval, and offers fully remote options for those beyond reasonable commuting distance.",
