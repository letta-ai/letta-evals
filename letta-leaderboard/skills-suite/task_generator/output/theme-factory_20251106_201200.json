  "task": "I'm creating a strategic vision document for a biotech pharmaceutical company that's pioneering breakthrough gene therapy treatments for rare diseases. This document will be presented to the board of directors, institutional investors, and potential strategic partners at our annual stakeholder summit. The content covers our 5-year research pipeline, clinical trial results, regulatory milestones, and commercialization strategy. The visual design needs to strike a delicate balance: it must convey scientific rigor and medical credibility while also feeling innovative and forward-thinking. The color palette should evoke both trust and cutting-edge science\u2014perhaps suggesting precision, purity, clinical excellence, and biotechnological advancement. The typography needs to feel authoritative enough for a medical/scientific context but modern enough to reflect our role as industry innovators. The audience includes MD-PhDs, venture capital partners, regulatory affairs experts, and C-suite executives aged 35-65 who value both scientific integrity and bold innovation. I'd like to see different visual design approaches with varying color schemes and typography combinations that would be appropriate for this high-stakes pharmaceutical strategy document, and then help me implement the one that best captures that balance of scientific credibility, medical trust, and innovative biotechnology leadership.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The agent presents multiple design theme options (at least 2-3) with specific color palettes and typography combinations that align with the biotech pharmaceutical context described in the task.\n2.

The agent waits for and requests explicit user selection/confirmation of a preferred theme before proceeding with application.\n4. The agent provides a clear summary or visualization of the final selected theme showing how the colors and fonts would work together for the pharmaceutical strategy document context.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent selects the theme-factory skill as the appropriate skill to complete this task.\n2. The agent loads the theme-factory/SKILL.md file to understand the available themes and application process.\n3. The agent loads the theme-showcase.pdf file to display available themes, and loads at least 2-3 specific theme files from the themes/ directory that are relevant to the biotech pharmaceutical context (such as arctic-frost.md, modern-minimalist.md, tech-innovation.md, or ocean-depths.md).\n4. The agent follows the proper workflow outlined in the skill: showing the showcase or describing themes, asking for user choice, waiting for selection, and then applying/describing the chosen theme in the context of the pharmaceutical document.",
