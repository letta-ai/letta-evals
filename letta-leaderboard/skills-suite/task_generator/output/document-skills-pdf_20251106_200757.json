  "task": "I have a financial report that needs to be analyzed and restructured. Here's what I need:\n\n1. Create a 4-page financial document with the following content:\n   - Page 1: Cover page with 'Q4 Financial Report' as title and 'Finance Department' as subtitle\n   - Page 2: A paragraph explaining revenue growth with at least 50 words\n   - Page 3: A table showing monthly expenses for October, November, and December with categories: Salaries ($45,000, $47,000, $46,500), Marketing ($12,000, $15,000, $18,000), Operations ($8,500, $9,200, $8,800)\n   - Page 4: Conclusion paragraph with future outlook (at least 30 words)\n\n2. Extract and save the table data from page 3 into a spreadsheet format (Excel file) with proper column headers and row labels.\n\n3. Create a summary document that contains:\n   - The title and subtitle from page 1\n   - The extracted table from page 3\n   - A calculated total row showing the sum of all expenses for each month\n   - A final total showing combined expenses across all three months\n\n4. Split the original 4-page document into two separate files: one containing pages 1-2 ('report_intro.pdf') and another containing pages 3-4 ('report_data.pdf').\n\n5. Create a watermark PDF with the text 'DRAFT - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION' positioned diagonally across the page, then apply this watermark to the 'report_data.pdf' file.\n\n6. Extract all text from both the watermarked data file and the intro file, then provide a word count for each section.\n\nProvide confirmation of each completed step along with the extracted text and calculated totals.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A 4-page financial document is created with all specified content (cover page, revenue paragraph, expense table with correct values, and conclusion paragraph), and the document is subsequently split into two files containing pages 1-2 and pages 3-4 respectively.\n2. The expense table data from page 3 is successfully extracted and converted into a spreadsheet format (Excel/CSV) with proper headers (months) and row labels (expense categories: Salaries, Marketing, Operations) containing all the specified numerical values.\n3. A summary document is created that includes the title and subtitle from the cover page, the expense table, calculated totals for each month (October: $65,500, November: $71,200, December: $73,300), and a grand total of all expenses ($210,000).\n4. A watermark containing the text 'DRAFT - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION' is created and successfully applied to the report_data.pdf file, and text is extracted from both the intro and data files with word counts provided for each section.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The document-skills/pdf skill is selected as the primary skill to complete the task.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the document-skills/pdf skill is loaded to access PDF manipulation instructions and examples.\n3. No additional files from the skill directory (forms.md, reference.md, or scripts) need to be loaded since the task only requires basic PDF operations covered in SKILL.md (creation, merging, splitting, text extraction, table extraction, and watermarking).\n4. The skill is used appropriately by applying pypdf for PDF creation, splitting, and watermarking operations; pdfplumber for table extraction; reportlab for creating new PDF documents; and pandas for converting table data to spreadsheet format, all as documented in the SKILL.md guide.",
