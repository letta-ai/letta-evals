  "task": "I lead a data journalism team at a regional newspaper, and we frequently publish interactive data stories about local issues. Our standard workflow involves: (1) Cleaning and validating CSV datasets from government sources (checking for missing values, validating date formats, ensuring numeric columns are properly typed), (2) Calculating summary statistics and identifying newsworthy patterns (year-over-year changes, outliers, geographic trends), (3) Generating a draft article following our editorial style guide (inverted pyramid structure, data-driven lede, context paragraphs, methodology disclosure), and (4) Creating a companion data visualization specification (chart type recommendations, axis labels, color schemes following our brand guidelines). I've developed a robust Python script that performs the data cleaning and validation steps using pandas, with specific rules we've refined over years of working with messy government data (like standardizing city name spellings and handling common date format variations). I also have a detailed style guide document that explains our editorial standards for data journalism: when to round numbers, how to attribute sources, guidelines for statistical significance claims, and our standard phrases for uncertainty. Additionally, I have a Markdown template that shows our preferred article structure with placeholder sections and example phrasing. I need to assemble all these components - the cleaning script, the style guide document, the article template, and comprehensive workflow instructions - into a standardized package that any reporter on my team can use to produce consistent, high-quality data stories. The package must be properly organized with logical directory structure, rigorously validated to ensure it meets professional distribution standards, and packaged into a format I can share across our newsroom. Guide me through building this complete solution from the ground up.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The agent must follow the complete skill creation process sequentially, including understanding the use case, planning reusable contents (script, references, assets), initializing a new skill directory, editing SKILL.md with appropriate content, and packaging the final skill.\n2. The created skill must include at least three types of bundled resources: a Python script for data cleaning/validation in scripts/, a style guide document in references/, and an article template in assets/, with each properly organized in the correct directory.\n3. The SKILL.md file must contain comprehensive workflow instructions written in imperative/infinitive form (verb-first instructions) that explain when to use the skill and how to use each bundled resource (the cleaning script, style guide, and article template).\n4. The skill must be validated and packaged into a distributable zip file using the packaging script, with the agent confirming successful validation and providing the packaged output ready for distribution to the journalism team.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent must identify and select the skill-creator skill as the appropriate skill for creating a reusable data journalism workflow package.\n2. The agent must load the skill-creator/SKILL.md file to access the skill creation process, design principles, and methodology.\n3. The agent must load and execute the init_skill.py script to initialize the skill structure, and load and execute the package_skill.py script to validate and package the final skill into a distributable format.\n4. The agent must appropriately apply the skill creation methodology by following the progressive disclosure principle (organizing content into SKILL.md vs bundled resources), using imperative/infinitive writing style throughout SKILL.md, and ensuring the skill is structured for another Claude instance to use effectively.",
