  "task": "I'm creating a pitch deck for a sustainable agriculture startup that's raising a Series A round. The company focuses on vertical farming technology and regenerative agriculture practices. I need the presentation to feel organic, fresh, and naturally aligned with our mission, while still looking professional enough for venture capital investors. The visual identity should evoke growth, nature, and innovation without feeling too corporate or sterile. Can you help me explore different visual design directions with color palettes and typography that would resonate with both environmentally-conscious stakeholders and traditional investors, then apply the one that best captures that natural, sustainable, growth-oriented aesthetic?",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The agent displays or references a showcase of multiple visual theme options with different color palettes and typography combinations for the user to review.\n2. The agent waits for and requests explicit user selection of a preferred theme before proceeding with application.\n3. The agent identifies and selects a theme that aligns with the natural, sustainable, growth-oriented aesthetic described (such as one with green/earth tones and organic feeling).\n4. The agent provides specific details about the selected theme including its color palette (with hex codes) and font pairings that will be applied to the pitch deck.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent correctly identifies and selects the theme-factory skill as the appropriate tool for this styling task.\n2. The agent loads and references the theme-factory/SKILL.md file to understand the workflow for displaying themes and applying them to artifacts.\n3. The agent loads the theme-showcase.pdf file to display available theme options and loads the specific theme file from the themes/ directory (such as botanical-garden.md or forest-canopy.md) that matches the sustainable agriculture aesthetic.\n4. The agent follows the proper usage workflow: first showing the showcase, then asking for theme selection, waiting for confirmation, and finally applying the chosen theme's specifications to the pitch deck as described in the skill instructions.",
