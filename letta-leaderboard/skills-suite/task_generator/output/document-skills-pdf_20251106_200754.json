  "task": "I have a scientific paper with a complex data table that I need to process. Here's what I need you to do:\n\n1. Create a 3-page research paper document with the following content:\n   - Page 1: Title 'Impact of Climate Variables on Crop Yield' with author 'Dr. Maria Rodriguez' and abstract text 'This study examines the relationship between temperature, precipitation, and crop productivity across multiple regions.'\n   - Page 2: Introduction section with two paragraphs explaining the research context\n   - Page 3: A results table with headers 'Region', 'Temperature (\u00b0C)', 'Precipitation (mm)', 'Yield (tons/ha)' and 4 data rows:\n     * North: 22, 850, 4.2\n     * South: 28, 450, 3.1\n     * East: 25, 920, 4.8\n     * West: 20, 1100, 5.2\n\n2. Extract the table from page 3 and convert it into a structured format (showing all rows and columns clearly)\n\n3. Create a separate summary document that contains:\n   - A title 'Data Summary Report'\n   - The extracted table data reformatted as text\n   - A calculated average for each numeric column (Temperature, Precipitation, Yield)\n   - Save this as 'summary.pdf'\n\n4. Merge the original 3-page paper with the summary document to create a 4-page combined report saved as 'full_report.pdf'\n\n5. Extract and display the metadata from the original paper (title, author, total pages)\n\n6. Extract all text content from page 3 of the combined report and provide it in the output\n\nProvide confirmation of each completed step along with the extracted table data, calculated averages, metadata, and text content from the final document.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A 3-page research paper PDF is created with the specified title, author, abstract, introduction, and data table with all four regions and their corresponding values\n2. The table from page 3 is successfully extracted and displayed in a structured format showing all headers (Region, Temperature, Precipitation, Yield) and all four data rows with correct values\n3. A summary PDF document is created containing a title, the reformatted table data, and calculated averages for Temperature (23.75\u00b0C), Precipitation (830mm), and Yield (4.325 tons/ha)\n4. The original 3-page paper and summary document are merged into a 4-page combined report, with metadata extraction showing correct title ('Impact of Climate Variables on Crop Yield'), author ('Dr. Maria Rodriguez'), and page count, and text content from page 3 of the combined report is extracted and displayed",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The document-skills/pdf skill is selected to complete this task\n2. The SKILL.md file from document-skills/pdf is loaded to access PDF manipulation instructions and code examples\n3. No additional files beyond SKILL.md are required or need to be loaded for this task (forms.md, reference.md, and scripts are not needed for basic PDF creation, table extraction, merging, and metadata operations)\n4. The skill is used appropriately by applying pypdf for PDF creation and merging, pdfplumber for table extraction from the specified page, reportlab for creating formatted PDF documents with text and tables, and pypdf for metadata extraction, following the patterns and examples provided in SKILL.md",
