  "task": "I'm organizing a scientific conference and need help processing the conference program materials. Here's what I need:\n\n1. Create a 5-page conference program document with the following structure:\n   - Page 1: Conference title 'International Symposium on Data Science 2024' with venue 'Boston Convention Center' and dates 'June 15-17, 2024'\n   - Page 2: A table showing the Day 1 schedule with columns 'Time', 'Session', 'Speaker', 'Room' containing 4 sessions:\n     * 09:00-10:30, 'Opening Keynote', 'Dr. James Wilson', 'Hall A'\n     * 11:00-12:30, 'Machine Learning Applications', 'Prof. Linda Zhang', 'Room 201'\n     * 14:00-15:30, 'Data Visualization', 'Dr. Ahmed Hassan', 'Room 202'\n     * 16:00-17:30, 'Ethics in AI', 'Dr. Emily Roberts', 'Hall A'\n   - Page 3: A similar table for Day 2 schedule with 4 different sessions and speakers\n   - Page 4: Sponsor information with logos and company names (create placeholder text for 3 sponsors)\n   - Page 5: General information about parking, Wi-Fi, and contact details\n\n2. Extract both schedule tables from pages 2 and 3, then create a consolidated Excel spreadsheet containing all sessions from both days with a column indicating which day each session occurs on.\n\n3. Create a 'Quick Reference' document containing only the conference title, dates, and both day schedules (merge pages 1-3 from the original), then rotate this entire document 90 degrees to landscape orientation. Save as 'quick_reference.pdf'.\n\n4. Create a separate one-page document with 'DRAFT VERSION - NOT FOR PUBLICATION' as a watermark, then apply this watermark only to pages 2 and 3 (the schedule pages) of the original 5-page document. Save as 'program_draft.pdf'.\n\n5. From the watermarked draft, extract pages 4-5 (sponsors and general info) into a separate document called 'logistics.pdf', then password-protect it with the password 'Conference2024!' and save as 'logistics_secure.pdf'.\n\n6. Extract and display the complete text content from page 2 of the watermarked draft document, showing all session details.\n\n7. Finally, extract metadata from both 'quick_reference.pdf' and 'program_draft.pdf' and report the total number of pages in each.\n\nProvide confirmation of each completed step, display the extracted schedule tables in structured format, show the text content from page 2, and report the metadata information.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. All seven PDF documents are successfully created with the specified content: original 5-page program, quick_reference.pdf (rotated landscape), program_draft.pdf (with watermark on pages 2-3), logistics.pdf, and logistics_secure.pdf (password-protected)\n2. The Excel spreadsheet is created containing consolidated schedule data from both Day 1 and Day 2 with all required columns including a day indicator\n3. The extracted text content from page 2 of the watermarked draft is displayed, showing all session details including times, session names, speakers, and rooms\n4. Metadata is extracted and reported for both quick_reference.pdf and program_draft.pdf, confirming the correct number of pages in each document (3 pages for quick reference, 5 pages for draft)",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The document-skills/pdf skill is selected and identified as relevant for the task\n2. The SKILL.md file from the document-skills/pdf skill is loaded into the context\n3. No additional files beyond SKILL.md are required for this task as it uses only the core PDF operations covered in the main guide\n4. The skill is used appropriately with correct application of pypdf for merging/splitting/rotating/watermarking operations, pdfplumber for text and table extraction, reportlab for PDF creation, and pandas for Excel export of extracted table data",
