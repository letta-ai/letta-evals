  "task": "I'm organizing a workshop series and need help managing the registration materials. Here's what I need:\n\n1. Create three separate registration confirmation documents:\n   - Confirmation A: Header 'Workshop Registration Confirmed', participant name 'Alice Johnson', workshop 'Python for Data Science', date 'March 15, 2024', session time '9:00 AM - 12:00 PM', location 'Room 301'\n   - Confirmation B: Same format but for participant 'Robert Martinez', workshop 'Machine Learning Basics', date 'March 16, 2024', session time '2:00 PM - 5:00 PM', location 'Room 405'\n   - Confirmation C: Same format but for participant 'Emily Watson', workshop 'Deep Learning Fundamentals', date 'March 17, 2024', session time '10:00 AM - 1:00 PM', location 'Room 302'\n\n2. Merge all three confirmations into a single document called 'all_confirmations.pdf' in the order A, B, C.\n\n3. Extract the text from page 2 of the merged document and verify it contains Robert Martinez's information.\n\n4. Create a new document called 'workshop_roster.pdf' that contains a title 'Workshop Series Roster' and a table with columns 'Participant', 'Workshop', 'Date', 'Time', 'Room' showing all three registrations in tabular format.\n\n5. Remove password protection is NOT needed, but instead: Extract the table from 'workshop_roster.pdf' and display it in a structured text format.\n\n6. Create a certificate template document with 'CERTIFICATE OF ATTENDANCE' as the main heading and placeholder text 'This certifies that [NAME] has attended [WORKSHOP]'.\n\n7. Split 'all_confirmations.pdf' into three individual files named 'confirmation_alice.pdf', 'confirmation_robert.pdf', and 'confirmation_emily.pdf'.\n\n8. From 'confirmation_robert.pdf', extract all metadata and text content to verify the split was successful.\n\n9. Rotate the first page of 'workshop_roster.pdf' by 270 degrees (counter-clockwise) and save as 'workshop_roster_landscape.pdf'.\n\n10. Merge 'workshop_roster_landscape.pdf' with the certificate template to create a final packet called 'workshop_packet.pdf'.\n\nProvide confirmation of each step with the extracted text from step 3, the table data from step 5, and the metadata and text from step 8.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. All ten PDF documents are successfully created with correct content: three registration confirmations (A, B, C), merged confirmations file, workshop roster with table, certificate template, three split confirmation files, rotated roster, and final workshop packet.\n2. Text extraction operations are performed correctly: page 2 text from merged confirmations showing Robert Martinez's details, table extraction from workshop roster showing all three participants' information in structured format, and complete metadata plus text from Robert's individual confirmation file.\n3. PDF manipulation operations are executed properly: merging three confirmations into one file, splitting the merged file back into three separate individual files, and rotating the workshop roster page by 270 degrees counter-clockwise.\n4. Final workshop packet is created by merging the landscape-oriented rotated roster with the certificate template, and all extracted content (step 3 text, step 5 table, step 8 metadata/text) is displayed in the output for verification.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The document-skills/pdf skill is selected and identified as the appropriate skill for handling multiple PDF creation, manipulation, merging, splitting, rotating, and text/table extraction tasks.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the document-skills/pdf skill is loaded to access instructions for PDF operations including creating PDFs with reportlab, merging/splitting with pypdf, extracting text with pdfplumber, rotating pages, and extracting tables.\n3. No additional files beyond SKILL.md are required for this task, as it involves standard PDF operations that are covered in the main skill documentation without needing forms.md, reference.md, or any scripts from the scripts directory.\n4. The skill's methods are applied appropriately: reportlab for creating new PDFs with text and tables, pypdf's PdfWriter/PdfReader for merging and splitting operations, page rotation using pypdf's rotate() method, and pdfplumber for extracting text and tables from specific pages.",
