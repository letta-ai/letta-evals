  "task": "I want you to create an abstract visual meditation on the concept of 'negative space as language' - the idea that what isn't there speaks as loudly as what is. This should be a single-page composition that feels like it could be featured in a contemporary design journal or exhibited at a modernist gallery. The piece should use restraint, precision, and sophisticated spatial relationships to communicate meaning through absence rather than presence. I'm looking for something that demonstrates absolute mastery of composition - where every element (or lack thereof) feels intentional and purposeful. The final work should look like it was created by someone at the pinnacle of their craft, with meticulous attention to balance, proportion, and visual hierarchy. This isn't about filling space; it's about making emptiness speak.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A single-page visual composition (.pdf or .png) is created that explores the concept of negative space as a primary communication method.\n2. The design demonstrates sophisticated restraint with minimal elements and extensive use of empty space that feels intentional and meaningful.\n3. The composition exhibits museum-quality craftsmanship with precise placement, perfect balance, and masterful spatial relationships.\n4. The piece includes a .md file containing the design philosophy that guided the creation of the visual work.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The canvas-design skill is selected as the primary skill for completing the task.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the canvas-design skill is loaded and referenced during the task execution.\n3. Appropriate font files from the canvas-fonts directory are loaded and used to create sophisticated typography in the composition.\n4. The skill is used appropriately by following the two-step process: first creating a design philosophy in a .md file, then expressing that philosophy visually through a refined canvas creation that emphasizes visual communication over text, with multiple refinement passes to achieve masterpiece-level quality.",
