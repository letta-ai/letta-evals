  "task": "I need to analyze a technical document and create a restructured version with enhanced security. Here's what I need:\n\n1. Create a sample technical specification document (6 pages) with the following content:\n   - Page 1: Cover page with title 'API Integration Specification v2.3'\n   - Page 2: Table of Contents listing sections\n   - Page 3: Introduction paragraph and a table with 5 API endpoints (columns: Endpoint, Method, Description, Auth Required)\n   - Page 4: Security requirements section with 3 paragraphs\n   - Page 5: Implementation guidelines with 2 paragraphs\n   - Page 6: Appendix with contact information\n\n2. Extract the metadata from this document and display it\n\n3. Extract only the table from page 3 and format it clearly for review\n\n4. Create three separate documents by splitting:\n   - Cover and TOC (pages 1-2) \u2192 'spec_intro.pdf'\n   - Technical content (pages 3-5) \u2192 'spec_technical.pdf'\n   - Appendix (page 6) \u2192 'spec_appendix.pdf'\n\n5. Rotate page 3 of the technical content file 180 degrees and save it as 'spec_technical_rotated.pdf'\n\n6. Create a new watermark document containing the text 'DRAFT - INTERNAL USE ONLY' positioned diagonally\n\n7. Apply this watermark to all pages of 'spec_technical_rotated.pdf' and save as 'spec_technical_watermarked.pdf'\n\n8. Merge all three split documents back together in this order: intro, watermarked technical content, appendix. Save as 'spec_final.pdf'\n\n9. Extract and provide the complete text from pages 4-5 of the final merged document\n\n10. Apply password protection to 'spec_final.pdf' with password 'TechSpec2024!' and save as 'spec_final_protected.pdf'\n\nProvide confirmation of each step with the extracted table from step 3 and the text content from step 9.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A 6-page technical specification PDF is created with all specified content (cover, TOC, API table, security section, implementation guidelines, and appendix), and three split documents are generated correctly\n2. The technical content file is rotated 180 degrees, a watermark is created and applied to produce a watermarked version, and all documents are merged back in the correct order\n3. The table from page 3 is extracted and displayed clearly showing all 5 API endpoints with their columns (Endpoint, Method, Description, Auth Required)\n4. The final merged document is password-protected with the specified password, and the complete text from pages 4-5 of the final document (security requirements and implementation guidelines) is extracted and provided",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The document-skills/pdf skill is selected to handle the task\n2. The SKILL.md file from the document-skills/pdf skill is loaded to access PDF manipulation instructions\n3. No additional files beyond SKILL.md are required for this task as it uses core pypdf, pdfplumber, and reportlab functionality covered in the main guide\n4. The skill is used appropriately with correct implementation of PDF creation (reportlab), text/table extraction (pdfplumber), document manipulation (pypdf for splitting, merging, rotating, watermarking), and password protection as documented in the SKILL.md file",
