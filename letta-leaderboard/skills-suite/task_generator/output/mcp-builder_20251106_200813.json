  "task": "I need to create a Python-based integration for the Hacker News API (https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0). This free API provides access to stories, comments, users, and live updates from Hacker News without requiring authentication.\n\nBuild a server that provides these capabilities:\n1. Fetch top stories (up to 500 story IDs available)\n2. Get detailed information about a specific story by ID (title, author, score, time, URL, text)\n3. Retrieve user profile information by username (karma, about, submitted stories)\n4. Get all comments for a story (recursively fetching nested comment threads)\n5. Search for stories by keywords in titles\n\nThe API returns data at endpoints like:\n- https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json (array of story IDs)\n- https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{id}.json (story/comment details)\n- https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/user/{username}.json (user info)\n\nEach tool should support both JSON and Markdown output formats. Handle pagination thoughtfully since the top stories list can be very long - allow users to specify how many stories to fetch. When fetching comments, implement a max depth parameter to prevent excessive API calls on deeply nested threads. Design error messages that guide the AI toward solutions when story IDs don't exist or usernames aren't found.\n\nPay special attention to rate limiting - while the API doesn't officially document limits, implement respectful throttling. Also handle the case where items might be deleted (the API returns null).\n\nAfter implementing the server, create 10 challenging evaluation questions that require an AI to combine multiple tools strategically. Questions should involve exploring the data deeply - like finding the most active commenter on a specific controversial story, or identifying which top story author has the highest karma, or finding stories about a specific technology topic that reached the front page.\n\nImplement this following professional standards for API integrations, including comprehensive input validation using Pydantic, consistent error handling with clear messages, proper async patterns, and well-documented tool descriptions with examples.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A complete Python MCP server is implemented with at least 5 tools covering the core Hacker News API functionality (top stories, story details, user profiles, comments, and search/filtering)\n2. All tools include proper input validation using Pydantic models, support both JSON and Markdown output formats, and implement pagination or limiting parameters where appropriate\n3. The server includes comprehensive documentation for each tool with clear descriptions, parameter explanations, return value schemas, and usage examples in docstrings\n4. A set of 10 evaluation questions is created in proper XML format, where each question is complex (requiring multiple tool calls), read-only, independent, realistic, verifiable with a single clear answer, and tests the AI's ability to effectively explore and combine the Hacker News API tools",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The mcp-builder skill is selected and explicitly loaded to complete the task\n2. The SKILL.md file for the mcp-builder skill is loaded and referenced during the implementation process\n3. The appropriate additional reference files are loaded including mcp_best_practices.md, python_mcp_server.md, and evaluation.md, and these files guide the implementation decisions\n4. The skill's four-phase workflow (Deep Research and Planning, Implementation, Review and Refine, Create Evaluations) is followed appropriately, with evidence of proper research into the Hacker News API, systematic implementation following Python best practices, quality review using the checklist, and evaluation creation following the evaluation guide's methodology",
