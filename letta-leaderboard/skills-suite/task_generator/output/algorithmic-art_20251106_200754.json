  "task": "I'm captivated by the mesmerizing patterns of murmuration - when thousands of starlings move together in the sky, creating fluid, ever-shifting shapes that seem to have a collective intelligence. The way individual birds follow simple rules yet produce this breathtaking emergent choreography fascinates me. I'd love to experience this as a computational piece that captures the essence of collective behavior and emergent patterns. Create something that lets me explore different flock behaviors - perhaps adjusting how strongly birds align with their neighbors, how quickly they respond to the group, or how cohesive the flock remains. I want to be able to navigate through different seeds to discover unique formations and patterns that emerge from the system. Make it so I can experiment with the parameters in real-time and see how small changes in individual behavior create dramatically different collective patterns.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. An algorithmic philosophy document (4-6 paragraphs) is created that articulates a generative aesthetic movement related to collective behavior, emergent patterns, or flock dynamics, emphasizing computational processes, emergent behavior, and algorithmic expression rather than static imagery.\n2. A self-contained HTML artifact is produced that implements a working p5.js generative algorithm expressing the philosophy through code, with the algorithm running successfully and producing visual output related to collective/emergent behavior.\n3. The artifact includes interactive parameter controls (sliders or inputs) that allow real-time adjustment of system behaviors such as alignment strength, cohesion, responsiveness, or similar flock-related parameters, with changes immediately affecting the visual output.\n4. The artifact includes fully functional seed navigation features (seed display, previous/next buttons, random button, and jump-to-seed input) that allow exploration of different variations, with each seed producing reproducible and unique patterns.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The algorithmic-art skill is selected and identified as the appropriate skill for this task involving generative/computational art creation.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the algorithmic-art skill is loaded and its instructions are followed, including the two-step process of creating an algorithmic philosophy first, then implementing it in p5.js code.\n3. The templates/viewer.html file is loaded and used as the required starting point for the HTML artifact, maintaining the fixed sections (Anthropic branding, layout structure, seed controls, action buttons) while replacing only the variable sections (algorithm, parameters, parameter controls).\n4. The skill's core principles are appropriately applied: seeded randomness is implemented for reproducibility, the algorithm expresses the philosophy (not a copied pattern), parameters emerge naturally from the system's needs, the craftsmanship emphasizes a meticulously refined implementation, and the final artifact is a single self-contained HTML file with p5.js loaded from CDN.",
