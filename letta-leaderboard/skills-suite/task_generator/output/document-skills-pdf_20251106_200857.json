  "task": "I'm organizing a scientific conference and need to prepare a multi-format proceedings document. Here's what I need:\n\n1. Create a 5-page conference proceedings document with:\n   - Page 1: Conference title 'International Symposium on Data Science 2024', venue 'Boston Convention Center', dates 'June 15-17, 2024', and organizing committee names (Dr. Emily Watson, Dr. James Liu)\n   - Page 2: Keynote speaker abstracts - two paragraphs describing talks by 'Prof. Michael Torres' on 'AI Ethics' and 'Dr. Rachel Kim' on 'Quantum Computing Applications'\n   - Page 3: A table of accepted papers with columns 'Paper ID', 'Title', 'Lead Author', 'Session' containing 5 entries (IDs: P001-P005, with titles like 'Neural Network Optimization', 'Blockchain Security', etc., and sessions A, B, or C)\n   - Page 4: Conference schedule showing three parallel sessions with time slots from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM\n   - Page 5: Sponsor acknowledgments listing Gold, Silver, and Bronze sponsors\n\n2. Extract only pages 3 and 4 (the papers table and schedule) and save them as 'proceedings_reference.pdf'\n\n3. From the reference document, extract the papers table and display it in a clearly structured format\n\n4. Create a certificate template document with 'CERTIFICATE OF PRESENTATION' as a header, 'Awarded to:' with blank space, and 'For presenting research at ISDS 2024' at the bottom. Rotate this certificate 270 degrees counter-clockwise and save as 'certificate_template.pdf'\n\n5. Create a second version of the original proceedings where page 2 (keynote abstracts) is rotated 90 degrees clockwise while all other pages remain in portrait orientation. Save this as 'proceedings_mixed.pdf'\n\n6. Apply a watermark that says 'PRELIMINARY DRAFT - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE' to all pages of 'proceedings_mixed.pdf' and save as 'proceedings_draft.pdf'\n\n7. Merge three documents in this order: the certificate template, the draft proceedings, and the reference guide to create 'proceedings_complete.pdf'\n\n8. Extract metadata from 'proceedings_complete.pdf' showing total page count and any document properties\n\n9. Encrypt 'proceedings_complete.pdf' with password 'ISDS2024Secure' and save as 'proceedings_final.pdf'\n\n10. From the final encrypted document, extract all text from the page containing the papers table and verify the data is intact\n\nProvide confirmation for each step, the structured table from step 3, metadata from step 8, and extracted text from step 10.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. All required documents are created with correct content: original 5-page proceedings, reference guide (pages 3-4), rotated certificate, mixed orientation version, watermarked draft, merged complete document, and encrypted final document\n2. Document manipulations are performed correctly: pages extracted and split properly, specific pages rotated as specified (certificate 270\u00b0 CCW, keynote page 90\u00b0 CW), watermark applied to all pages, and documents merged in correct order\n3. Table extraction produces structured output showing all 5 paper entries with their IDs (P001-P005), titles, lead authors, and session assignments\n4. Security and verification tasks completed: password encryption applied successfully, metadata extracted showing correct page count (should be 8 pages total: 1 certificate + 5 proceedings + 2 reference), and text successfully extracted from the papers table page in the encrypted document",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The pdf skill from document-skills/pdf is selected for this task\n2. The SKILL.md file from document-skills/pdf is loaded to access PDF manipulation instructions and code examples\n3. No additional files beyond SKILL.md are required for this task as all necessary functionality (creation, merging, splitting, rotation, watermarking, encryption, text extraction, table extraction, and metadata extraction) is covered in the main skill file\n4. The skill is used appropriately with correct application of pypdf for document manipulation (merging, splitting, rotation, encryption), pdfplumber for table and text extraction, reportlab for PDF creation and watermarking, and proper handling of encrypted documents for text extraction",
