  "task": "I need to create a 5-slide presentation about sustainable urban farming for a city council meeting. The presentation should have a 16:9 aspect ratio and follow this structure:\n\nSlide 1: Title slide with \"Sustainable Urban Farming Initiative\" and subtitle \"Growing Food in City Spaces\"\n\nSlide 2: \"Benefits of Urban Farming\" with three key benefits listed as bullet points\n\nSlide 3: \"Implementation Strategies\" with a two-column layout - strategies on the left (as bullets) and a gray placeholder for a future chart on the right\n\nSlide 4: \"Case Studies\" with three example cities and their success metrics in a table format\n\nSlide 5: \"Next Steps\" with action items as numbered list\n\nThe design should use earth-toned colors appropriate for a sustainability topic - think sage green, terracotta, and cream. Use clean, modern typography with good contrast for readability. After creating the presentation, generate a thumbnail grid so I can verify the visual layout of all slides at once.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A PowerPoint presentation file (.pptx) is created with exactly 5 slides in 16:9 aspect ratio containing the specified content structure (title slide, benefits, implementation strategies, case studies, and next steps).\n2. The presentation uses an earth-toned color palette appropriate for sustainability (sage green, terracotta, cream, or similar natural colors) with good text contrast for readability.\n3. Slide 3 includes a two-column layout with text content on one side and a gray placeholder area for a chart on the other side, and Slide 4 contains a properly formatted table with case study data.\n4. A thumbnail grid image is generated showing all 5 slides in a visual overview for layout verification.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent selects the document-skills/pptx skill as the appropriate skill for creating a PowerPoint presentation.\n2. The agent loads and reads the SKILL.md file from the document-skills/pptx skill to understand the presentation creation workflow.\n3. The agent loads and uses the html2pptx.md file to understand HTML-to-PowerPoint conversion syntax, and uses scripts/html2pptx.js for the conversion process, and uses scripts/thumbnail.py for generating the thumbnail grid.\n4. The agent follows the html2pptx workflow correctly by: (a) reading the entire html2pptx.md file without range limits, (b) creating HTML files with proper dimensions and structure, (c) using class=\"placeholder\" for chart areas, (d) running JavaScript with the html2pptx library to convert HTML to PowerPoint, and (e) generating thumbnails for visual validation using the thumbnail.py script.",
