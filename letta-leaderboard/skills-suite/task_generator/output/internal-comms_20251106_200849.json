  "task": "Our marketing team needs to send out a weekly status update to the leadership team. This week, we successfully launched our Q2 campaign across all social media channels, achieving 2.3M impressions in the first 72 hours, which exceeded our target by 35%. We also finalized the partnership agreement with three micro-influencers for our summer product line. For next week, we're planning to kick off the email nurture sequence for leads generated from the campaign, schedule content shoots for our June product launch, and begin A/B testing new ad creatives. We're currently facing two issues: the creative team is backlogged and can't deliver the video assets until next Friday (originally due this Wednesday), which might delay our video ad launch, and we're still waiting on legal approval for the influencer content guidelines before we can proceed with content creation. Write an update that clearly communicates our progress, upcoming priorities, and challenges to our VP of Marketing and CMO.",
