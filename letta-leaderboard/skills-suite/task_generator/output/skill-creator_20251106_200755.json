  "task": "I'm building a specialized tool for my video production team. We work with video metadata files (JSON format) that contain information about our projects - things like timecodes, scene descriptions, speaker names, and project status. I need something that will: (1) Parse these JSON metadata files and extract key information, (2) Generate a formatted production report in Markdown that follows our studio's standard template (with sections for Project Overview, Scene Breakdown, and Production Notes), (3) Validate that required fields are present (project_name, duration, scenes array), and (4) Flag any scenes missing critical information like timecodes or descriptions. I've already created a Python validation script that checks for required fields and identifies incomplete scenes - it's been tested and works reliably. I also have our studio's Markdown report template that shows exactly how we format production reports, including the header structure and table layouts we use. I want to package all of this - the validation script, the report template, and clear workflow instructions - into something I can distribute to my team so everyone follows the same process. The package needs to be properly structured, validated for completeness, and ready to share. Can you help me create this from scratch, going through the full process to make it production-ready?",

The agent must create or populate the skill with appropriate bundled resources including a Python validation script in the scripts/ directory and a Markdown report template in either references/ or assets/ directory.\n3. The agent must edit the SKILL.md file to include proper YAML frontmatter (name and description), purpose statement, usage instructions, and references to the bundled resources (validation script and report template).\n4. The agent must validate and package the completed skill using the packaging script to create a distributable zip file.",

The agent must identify and select the skill-creator skill as the appropriate skill for this task involving creating a new reusable package with scripts, templates, and workflow instructions.\n2. The agent must load the skill-creator/SKILL.md file to access the skill creation process, progressive disclosure principles, and structural guidance.\n3. The agent must load and use the init_skill.py script to initialize the skill structure, and load and use the package_skill.py script to validate and package the final skill.\n4. The agent must follow the skill creation process outlined in SKILL.md appropriately: understanding the use case (Step 1), planning reusable contents (Step 2), initializing with the script (Step 3), editing SKILL.md and adding resources (Step 4), and packaging with validation (Step 5).",
