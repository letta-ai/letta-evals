  "task": "I need a single-page abstract visual composition that explores the philosophical concept of 'synesthetic translation' - the idea that one sensory experience can be expressed through another sense's language. Specifically, I want you to create a piece that translates the tactile sensation of different textures (rough stone, smooth glass, soft fabric, sharp metal) into purely visual form without literally depicting these materials. The work should use abstract geometric language, varied line weights, spatial density, and a sophisticated limited palette (no more than 4 colors) to evoke the feeling of touching different surfaces through sight alone. This should be museum-quality work that demonstrates absolute mastery - the kind of piece that looks like it required weeks of meticulous refinement by someone at the peak of their craft. The composition should feel like it belongs in a contemporary art exhibition on perception and cross-modal experience, not like decorative design. Text, if present at all, should be minimal and function as part of the visual architecture rather than explanation. I want both the conceptual framework document and the finished visual piece as deliverables.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A design philosophy document (.md file) is created that articulates a visual aesthetic movement in 4-6 paragraphs, emphasizing visual expression, spatial communication, minimal text, and expert craftsmanship without mentioning the specific concept of synesthetic translation literally.\n2. A single-page visual composition (.pdf or .png) is created that abstractly explores the concept of synesthetic translation through geometric forms, varied visual textures (line weights, spatial density, patterns), and sophisticated use of space.\n3. The visual composition uses a restrained color palette (maximum 4 colors) and contains minimal to no text, with any textual elements functioning as visual accents integrated into the composition rather than explanatory labels.\n4. The final artwork demonstrates museum-quality craftsmanship with meticulous attention to detail, perfect spacing with no overlapping elements, all content contained within canvas boundaries with proper margins, and a cohesive sophisticated aesthetic that appears to be the product of extensive refinement by a master designer.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The canvas-design skill is selected and identified as the appropriate skill for completing this task of creating abstract visual artwork with a design philosophy.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the canvas-design skill is loaded and its instructions are followed, including the two-step process of creating a design philosophy first, then expressing it visually on canvas.\n3. Font files from the canvas-fonts directory are loaded and used appropriately in the visual composition, with different fonts selected to enhance the sophisticated, design-forward aesthetic.\n4. The skill is used appropriately by following the core principles: creating a visual philosophy (not literal templates), emphasizing minimal text as visual accent, using spatial/formal expression rather than explanatory paragraphs, stressing expert craftsmanship repeatedly, avoiding overlapping elements, and producing work that appears meticulously crafted with museum-quality execution.",
