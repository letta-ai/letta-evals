  "task": "I'm fascinated by the way water droplets create ripples when they hit a calm surface - those concentric circles that overlap and interfere with each other, creating beautiful patterns of reinforcement and cancellation. I'd love to see this phenomenon expressed as a living computational piece that captures the essence of wave interference. Create something where I can explore different configurations by adjusting how the system behaves, and let me navigate through different variations to find the most mesmerizing patterns. Make it interactive so I can experiment with the parameters in real-time.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. An algorithmic philosophy document (4-6 paragraphs) is created that articulates a computational approach to wave interference, emphasizing algorithmic expression, emergent behavior, and expert craftsmanship\n2. A single self-contained HTML artifact is produced that runs immediately in a browser, implementing the algorithmic philosophy through p5.js code with seeded randomness\n3. The artifact includes interactive parameter controls (sliders/inputs) that allow real-time adjustment of system behaviors relevant to the wave interference concept (such as quantities, scales, frequencies, or other tunable properties)\n4. The artifact includes functional seed navigation controls (previous/next/random/jump buttons with seed display) that allow exploration of different variations while maintaining reproducibility",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The algorithmic-art skill is selected as the skill to use for this task\n2. The SKILL.md file from the algorithmic-art skill is loaded and referenced to understand the two-step process (philosophy creation followed by p5.js implementation)\n3. The templates/viewer.html file is loaded and used as the starting point for creating the HTML artifact, maintaining its fixed structure (layout, Anthropic branding, seed controls, actions) while replacing variable sections (algorithm and parameters)\n4. The skill's principles are applied appropriately: an original algorithmic philosophy is created (not copying existing work), seeded randomness is implemented for reproducibility, the conceptual essence (wave interference/ripples) is woven into the algorithm subtly rather than literally, and the implementation emphasizes expert craftsmanship with carefully tuned parameters",
