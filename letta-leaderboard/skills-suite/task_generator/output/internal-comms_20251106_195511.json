  "task": "Our engineering team just completed a major infrastructure migration to Kubernetes last week, which improved deployment speed by 40%. This week, we're focusing on implementing automated rollback capabilities and updating documentation. However, we're running into blockers with the monitoring integration - the Prometheus setup isn't capturing all the metrics we need, and we're waiting on the DevOps team to help configure custom exporters. This is delaying our observability goals by at least a week. Write a team update that covers what we accomplished, what we're working on, and what's blocking us.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The communication includes a clear section describing progress or accomplishments from the previous period, specifically mentioning the Kubernetes migration and 40% deployment speed improvement.\n2. The communication includes a clear section describing current plans or work in progress, specifically covering automated rollback capabilities and documentation updates.\n3. The communication includes a clear section identifying problems or blockers, specifically detailing the Prometheus monitoring integration issues and the dependency on the DevOps team.\n4. The communication follows a structured format with distinct sections that organize the three main topics (progress, plans, and problems) in a logical and easy-to-read manner.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent correctly identifies that the internal-comms skill is relevant for writing a team update about progress, plans, and problems.\n2. The agent loads the internal-comms SKILL.md file to understand how to approach the task.\n3. The agent loads the examples/3p-updates.md file, which is the appropriate guideline for this type of progress/plans/problems team update.\n4. The agent follows the specific instructions, formatting guidelines, and tone recommendations provided in the 3p-updates.md file to create the communication.",
