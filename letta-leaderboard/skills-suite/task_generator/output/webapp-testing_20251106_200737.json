  "task": "I have a static HTML file at /tmp/registration_form.html that contains a user registration form with the following elements:\n\n- A text input field with id=\"username\" for entering a username\n- An email input field with id=\"email\" for entering an email address\n- A password input field with id=\"password\" for entering a password\n- A checkbox with id=\"terms\" for accepting terms and conditions\n- A submit button with text \"Register\"\n- A div with id=\"status\" that displays submission status messages\n\nThe form has client-side JavaScript that validates inputs and displays messages in the status div when the form is submitted. I need you to:\n\n1. Open the HTML file in a browser and capture a screenshot of the initial form state\n2. Fill in the username field with \"testuser123\"\n3. Fill in the email field with \"test@example.com\"\n4. Fill in the password field with \"SecurePass456!\"\n5. Check the terms and conditions checkbox\n6. Click the Register button\n7. Wait for any JavaScript to execute and capture a screenshot of the final state\n8. Extract and report the text content from the status div to confirm what message was displayed\n9. Capture any console logs that appeared during the form interaction\n\nProvide me with both screenshots, the status message text, any console output, and confirm whether the form accepted the inputs successfully.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. Two screenshots are provided: one showing the initial empty form state and one showing the final state after form submission\n2. All form fields (username, email, password, terms checkbox) are correctly filled with the specified values and the Register button is clicked\n3. The text content from the status div is extracted and reported, clearly showing what message was displayed after form submission\n4. Console logs captured during the interaction are reported, and a clear summary is provided confirming whether the form submission was successful",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The webapp-testing skill is selected and identified as relevant for the task of testing a local HTML form with browser automation\n2. The SKILL.md file from the webapp-testing skill is loaded to understand how to approach static HTML automation and Playwright usage patterns\n3. The static_html_automation.py example file is loaded or referenced to understand the proper approach for testing static HTML files using file:// URLs\n4. A native Python Playwright script is created that correctly uses file:// URLs for local HTML, waits for JavaScript execution with appropriate wait conditions, captures screenshots, extracts DOM content, and captures console logs following the patterns demonstrated in the skill resources",
