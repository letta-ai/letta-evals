  "task": "I have a confidential financial report that needs special handling. Please help me with the following workflow:\n\n1. Create a 3-page financial report with these contents:\n   - Page 1: A table showing monthly expenses for January through June with categories (Rent: $2000, Utilities: $300, Supplies: $450, Salaries: $8000, Marketing: $1200)\n   - Page 2: A summary paragraph analyzing the expense trends and noting that Q2 spending increased by 15%\n   - Page 3: Recommendations section with bullet points for cost reduction strategies\n\n2. Extract all tables from the document and save them to an Excel file showing the structured data\n\n3. Create a watermark document that says 'INTERNAL USE ONLY' in large, semi-transparent text\n\n4. Apply this watermark to all pages of the original financial report\n\n5. Extract and display the metadata from the watermarked document (number of pages, any title/author information)\n\n6. Rotate page 1 (the table page) 90 degrees clockwise to landscape orientation while keeping pages 2 and 3 in portrait\n\n7. Encrypt the final document with user password 'Finance2024' and owner password 'Admin2024'\n\n8. Extract all text from page 2 of the final encrypted document (you'll need to handle the password) and display it\n\nProvide confirmation and output for each step, particularly showing the extracted table data in step 2 and the text content from step 8.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A multi-page financial report PDF is created containing a table with monthly expenses, a summary paragraph about Q2 trends, and a recommendations section\n2. Tables are successfully extracted from the PDF and converted to Excel format with structured data showing the expense categories and amounts\n3. A watermarked version of the report is created with 'INTERNAL USE ONLY' text applied to all pages, and page 1 is rotated to landscape orientation while other pages remain portrait\n4. The final document is encrypted with the specified passwords ('Finance2024' as user password and 'Admin2024' as owner password), and text from page 2 is successfully extracted and displayed despite the encryption",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The document-skills/pdf skill is selected to handle the task\n2. The SKILL.md file from the document-skills/pdf skill is loaded into the context\n3. No additional files from the skill directory need to be loaded for this task as it focuses on core PDF operations (creation, extraction, watermarking, rotation, encryption) covered in SKILL.md\n4. The skill is used appropriately by applying pypdf for PDF manipulation (merging, rotating, encrypting), pdfplumber for table extraction, reportlab for PDF creation, and pandas for Excel export, following the patterns and examples provided in the skill documentation",
