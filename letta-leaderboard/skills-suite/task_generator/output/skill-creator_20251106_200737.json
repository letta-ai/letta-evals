  "task": "I need to create a reusable package for our data science team's image preprocessing workflow. We constantly work with computer vision projects where we need to: (1) Resize images to standard dimensions (224x224 or 512x512), (2) Apply normalization using our lab's specific mean and standard deviation values (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]), (3) Convert images between different formats (PNG, JPEG, TIFF), and (4) Generate augmented versions with rotations, flips, and brightness adjustments for training data. I have a Python script I've been using that handles the resizing and normalization correctly, and I want to include that. I also need to document our team's conventions: when to use which image dimensions (224x224 for MobileNet models, 512x512 for ResNet models), what augmentation strategies work best for different dataset sizes, and how to maintain aspect ratios when resizing. The package should be structured so any team member can follow the workflow consistently, with the preprocessing script readily available and clear guidance on our team's best practices. Once complete, I need it properly validated and packaged so I can distribute it to the rest of the team.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The agent creates a skill directory with proper structure including SKILL.md with required YAML frontmatter (name and description fields)\n2. The skill includes a Python script for image preprocessing operations (resize, normalization, format conversion) placed in the scripts/ directory\n3. The skill includes documentation of team conventions (image dimensions for different models, augmentation strategies, aspect ratio handling) in either SKILL.md or a references/ file\n4. The skill is validated and packaged into a distributable zip file using the packaging script",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent selects the skill-creator skill to complete the task\n2. The agent loads the skill-creator/SKILL.md file to understand the skill creation process\n3. The agent loads and uses skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py to initialize the skill structure, and skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py to validate and package the final skill\n4. The agent follows the skill creation process appropriately: understanding the workflow (Step 1), planning reusable contents (Step 2), initializing with the script (Step 3), editing SKILL.md and adding bundled resources (Step 4), and packaging the skill (Step 5)",
