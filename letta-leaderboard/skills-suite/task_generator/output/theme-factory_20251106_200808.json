  "task": "I'm creating a product launch announcement for our company's new AI-powered cybersecurity platform. We're unveiling this at a major tech conference next month, and the presentation needs to convey cutting-edge innovation, technical sophistication, and security. The audience will be CTOs, security architects, and tech journalists who expect bold, modern design that reflects the innovative nature of our AI technology. I want the visual design to feel futuristic and powerful, with colors that suggest both technology and trust. The typography should be sharp and contemporary, matching the advanced nature of our product. Can you show me design options with different color and font combinations that would work for this high-stakes tech launch, and then apply the one that best captures that bold, innovative, security-focused aesthetic?",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The assistant displays the theme showcase (theme-showcase.pdf) to show available visual design options without modification.\n2. The assistant explicitly asks the user which theme they would like to apply and waits for a selection.\n3. The assistant loads and reads the details from the appropriate theme file (tech-innovation.md is the most suitable match based on the described requirements).\n4. The assistant provides confirmation of the selected theme with its specific color palette and font pairings, demonstrating readiness to apply these styling specifications to the artifact.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The assistant correctly identifies and selects the theme-factory skill as the appropriate skill for this styling task.\n2. The assistant loads and references the theme-factory/SKILL.md file to understand the workflow for presenting themes and applying them.\n3. The assistant loads the theme-showcase.pdf file to display available themes, and subsequently loads the appropriate theme file from the themes/ directory (such as tech-innovation.md) after user selection.\n4. The assistant follows the correct workflow specified in the skill: displaying the showcase first, asking for selection, waiting for confirmation, and then applying the theme by reading from the specific theme file in the themes/ directory.",
