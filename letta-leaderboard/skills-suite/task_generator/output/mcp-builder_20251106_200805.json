  "task": "I need to build a Python-based integration for the NASA APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API (https://api.nasa.gov/). This API provides daily astronomy pictures along with explanations written by professional astronomers.\n\nCreate a server that exposes these tools:\n1. Get today's astronomy picture of the day with its explanation and metadata\n2. Get the APOD for a specific date (supports dates from 1995-06-16 to present)\n3. Get a random APOD entry\n4. Search APODs within a date range and return a list of entries\n\nThe tools should support both JSON and Markdown output formats. For the search tool, implement proper pagination since date ranges can return many results - limit to 100 entries per request and provide clear truncation messages if more exist. Each tool needs comprehensive documentation explaining parameters, return formats, and usage examples.\n\nThe API requires an API key passed as the 'api_key' query parameter. The server should read this from an environment variable called NASA_API_KEY. The free tier allows 1000 requests per hour. Handle errors gracefully, especially for invalid dates (dates before 1995-06-16 or future dates) and network issues.\n\nError messages should guide the AI - for example, if a date is out of range, suggest valid date ranges; if the API rate limit is hit, explain when to retry.\n\nAfter implementation, create 10 evaluation questions that test whether an AI can effectively use these tools to answer complex queries about astronomy pictures. Questions should require multiple tool calls and exploration - like finding the most recent APOD about a specific celestial object, comparing pictures from different years, or identifying patterns in the types of images featured during certain time periods.\n\nBuild this following professional standards for this type of service integration, including proper schema validation with Pydantic, consistent error handling, and well-structured responses that respect character limits.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A complete Python MCP server implementation is provided that integrates with the NASA APOD API and includes all four required tools: get today's APOD, get APOD by date, get random APOD, and search APODs by date range.\n2. The implementation includes proper input validation using Pydantic models, handles the NASA_API_KEY environment variable for authentication, implements pagination for the search tool (max 100 entries), and supports both JSON and Markdown response formats.\n3. All tools have comprehensive docstrings that include parameter descriptions with examples, return type schemas, usage examples, and error handling documentation with actionable guidance for common issues (invalid dates, rate limits, etc.).\n4. A complete evaluation file is provided with 10 complex, realistic, read-only questions in XML format that require multiple tool calls and data exploration to answer, along with verified single-word or short-phrase answers that can be validated by string comparison.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The mcp-builder skill is selected and explicitly mentioned or referenced as the appropriate skill for this task.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the mcp-builder skill is loaded and its high-level workflow phases (Deep Research and Planning, Implementation, Review and Refine, Create Evaluations) are followed systematically.\n3. The Python Implementation Guide (reference/python_mcp_server.md), MCP Best Practices (reference/mcp_best_practices.md), and Evaluation Guide (reference/evaluation.md) are loaded and their guidelines are applied throughout the implementation, including proper use of Pydantic models, async/await patterns, response formatting standards, character limits, and evaluation question creation.\n4. The skill's process is used appropriately by first conducting research (loading MCP protocol documentation and Python SDK documentation via WebFetch), creating a comprehensive implementation plan, implementing the server following Python-specific best practices, and creating evaluations that meet all requirements (independent, read-only, complex, realistic, verifiable, stable questions).",
