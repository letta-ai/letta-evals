  "task": "I need to extract and analyze all comments from a business proposal document. The document content is:\n\n\"BUSINESS PROPOSAL\n\nExecutive Summary\nWe propose to develop a cloud-based inventory management system for retail businesses.\n\nProject Scope\nThe system will include real-time tracking, automated reordering, and analytics dashboards.\n\nTimeline\nPhase 1: Requirements gathering (4 weeks)\nPhase 2: Development (12 weeks)\nPhase 3: Testing and deployment (6 weeks)\n\nBudget\nTotal project cost: $150,000\nPayment terms: 30% upfront, 40% at midpoint, 30% on completion\n\nTeam\nProject Manager: Sarah Chen\nLead Developer: Michael Rodriguez\nQA Lead: Priya Patel\"\n\nThe document has the following comments embedded:\n- Comment on 'cloud-based inventory management system' by John Smith: 'Should we specify which cloud platform?'\n- Comment on '12 weeks' by Emily Davis: 'This seems aggressive. Can we add 2 weeks buffer?'\n- Comment on '$150,000' by Robert Johnson: 'Client budget is $140K. Need to revise.'\n- Comment on 'Sarah Chen' by Amanda White: 'Sarah is on leave in Q2. Assign alternate PM.'\n\nFirst, create this document with all the embedded comments. Then extract all comments from the document and provide a summary report listing: (1) the text each comment is attached to, (2) the comment author, (3) the comment text, and (4) the location in the document (section name). Finally, convert the document to markdown to verify the comments are properly embedded.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A Word document (.docx) is created containing the business proposal text with proper structure and sections\n2. All four comments are correctly embedded in the document at the specified locations (attached to 'cloud-based inventory management system', '12 weeks', '$150,000', and 'Sarah Chen')\n3. A comprehensive summary report is generated that accurately lists all comments with their associated text, authors, comment content, and document sections\n4. The document is converted to markdown or the raw XML is analyzed to verify that comments are properly embedded and extractable",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The document-skills/docx skill is selected to handle the Word document creation and comment extraction task\n2. The SKILL.md file for document-skills/docx is loaded to understand workflows for creating documents and accessing raw XML for comments\n3. The ooxml.md file is loaded for understanding comment XML structure, and either docx-js.md is used for creating the document with comments OR the Document library (document.py) and comment templates are used for adding comments to the document\n4. The skill is used appropriately by following the 'Raw XML access' workflow for reading comments from word/comments.xml, and either the 'Creating a new Word document' workflow or the 'Editing an existing Word document' workflow is used to create the document with embedded comments, with proper unpacking/packing if using the Document library approach",
