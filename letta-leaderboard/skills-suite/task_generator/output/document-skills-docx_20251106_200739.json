  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A Word document (.docx) is created containing the original contract text with proper structure and formatting\n2. All four requested changes are implemented as tracked changes: term (90\u2192120 days), payment timing (45\u219230 days), termination notice (21\u219230 days), and confidentiality period (3\u21925 years)\n3. The tracked changes only mark the specific text that changed (e.g., just \"90\" to \"120\"), not entire sentences or paragraphs, demonstrating minimal precise edits\n4. Verification is performed to confirm all changes were applied correctly and the final document is packed into a valid .docx file",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The document-skills/docx skill is selected for this task\n2. The SKILL.md file from document-skills/docx is loaded and the redlining workflow section is consulted for implementing tracked changes\n3. The ooxml.md file is loaded and used to understand the Document library API and tracked change patterns, and the unpack.py and pack.py scripts are used to unpack and repack the document\n4. The skill's redlining workflow is followed appropriately: document is created, unpacked, tracked changes are implemented using the Document library with proper OOXML markup (w:ins/w:del tags), changes follow the minimal precise edits principle, the document is packed, and verification is performed using pandoc or grep",
