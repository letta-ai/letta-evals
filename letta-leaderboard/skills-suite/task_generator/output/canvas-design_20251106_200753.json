  "task": "I want you to create a sophisticated single-page visual artwork that embodies the philosophical concept of 'liminal thresholds' - those in-between spaces where one state transitions to another, like dawn/dusk, doorways, or the moment between sleeping and waking. This should NOT be literal or illustrative; instead, it should use abstract visual language to evoke the tension and potential of transitional states. The composition should employ gradients, boundaries, or geometric divisions that suggest movement between zones while maintaining a sense of suspended animation. I'm looking for a museum-quality piece with a restrained color palette (maximum 4 colors), minimal textual elements that function as visual punctuation rather than explanation, and a level of craftsmanship that demonstrates absolute mastery - the kind of work that looks like it required weeks of refinement by a world-class designer. This should feel like it belongs in a contemporary art collection focused on phenomenology and spatial experience, not like a decorative poster. The final deliverable should include both the conceptual framework document and the finished visual composition.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A single-page visual artwork (.pdf or .png) is created that abstractly explores the concept of liminal thresholds through non-literal visual elements\n2. The composition uses a restrained color palette (4 or fewer colors) and incorporates minimal textual elements that function as visual components rather than explanatory text\n3. The artwork demonstrates visual techniques that evoke transitional states (such as gradients, geometric divisions, or boundary zones) while maintaining sophisticated abstract composition\n4. A separate design philosophy document (.md file) is provided that articulates the aesthetic framework used to create the artwork",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The canvas-design skill is selected and identified as appropriate for creating visual artwork\n2. The SKILL.md file from canvas-design is loaded and referenced to understand the two-step process of creating design philosophy then expressing it visually\n3. Font files from the canvas-fonts directory are accessed and used appropriately to ensure professional typography in the final composition\n4. The skill is used correctly by first creating a design philosophy (4-6 paragraphs as specified), then creating a visually-dominant artwork that minimizes text, emphasizes craftsmanship, and treats the work as a museum-quality art object rather than a decorated document",
