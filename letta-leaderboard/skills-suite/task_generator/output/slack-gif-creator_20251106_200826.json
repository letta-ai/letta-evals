  "task": "Create an animated GIF for Slack messages that shows a progress bar filling up from empty to complete. The animation should start with an empty progress bar (just an outline or background), then gradually fill from left to right with a vibrant color (like green or blue). As it fills, add a percentage counter above the bar that counts from 0% to 100% in sync with the fill progress. When the bar reaches 100%, add a satisfying completion effect - maybe a quick flash, a checkmark appearing, or a subtle bounce/pulse of the entire bar. The animation should be smooth and professional-looking, suitable for sharing in project update threads. Make it about 2-3 seconds long, optimize it for 480x480 dimensions, and ensure the final file is under 2MB for Slack message use. Use a clean, modern design with good contrast so it's easy to see at various sizes. Verify the file meets all requirements before completing.",

  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The slack-gif-creator skill is selected for this task\n2. The slack-gif-creator/SKILL.md file is loaded to understand the toolkit structure, validators, and optimization strategies\n3. Multiple additional files are loaded and used including: gif_builder.py for GIF assembly, validators.py for size checking, frame_composer.py for drawing elements, easing.py for smooth animations, and typography.py for rendering the percentage text\n4. The skill components are used appropriately: GIFBuilder creates frames with proper dimensions and FPS, easing functions provide smooth fill progression, typography renders the percentage counter, frame_composer draws the progress bar elements, and validators confirm the output meets Slack's 2MB limit for message GIFs",
