  "task": "I'm designing a wellness retreat brochure for a luxury spa and meditation center in the mountains. The retreat focuses on mindfulness, relaxation, and holistic healing. I need the visual design to feel serene, calming, and spa-like\u2014evoking tranquility and peace. The color palette should be soothing and gentle, perhaps with soft blues, lavenders, or muted pastels that create a sense of calm. The typography should be elegant but not overly formal, conveying warmth and approachability. The target audience is wellness-focused professionals aged 30-55 seeking stress relief and rejuvenation. Could you show me various design themes with different color and font combinations that would work for this wellness retreat context, and then help me apply the one that best captures that peaceful, restorative, spa-like atmosphere?",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The agent displays multiple theme options (at least 3-5) with visual examples showing different color palettes and font combinations suitable for a wellness/spa context.\n2. The agent explicitly asks the user to select their preferred theme and waits for a selection before proceeding.\n3. The agent provides a clear description of the selected theme including its specific colors (with hex codes) and font pairings.\n4. The agent confirms the theme application and describes how the chosen colors and fonts would be applied to create a serene, spa-like aesthetic for the wellness retreat brochure.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent selects and attempts to use the 'theme-factory' skill in response to this task.\n2. The agent loads and references the theme-factory/SKILL.md file to understand the skill's structure and workflow.\n3. The agent loads the theme-showcase.pdf file to display available themes, and subsequently loads at least one theme specification file from the themes/ directory (such as arctic-frost.md, botanical-garden.md, or ocean-depths.md) that matches the wellness/spa aesthetic.\n4. The agent follows the skill's prescribed workflow: first showing the theme showcase, asking for user selection, waiting for confirmation, and then applying the chosen theme with appropriate color and font specifications.",
