  "task": "I need you to create a sophisticated abstract visual piece that explores the concept of 'crystalline fragmentation' - the idea that solid structures can break into beautiful, geometric pieces while maintaining a hidden coherence. This should be a single-page composition that evokes the sensation of something whole being shattered into precise fragments, yet still feeling unified through color relationships, directional flow, or subtle repetition. The work should NOT be literal (no actual crystals or broken glass), but instead use abstract geometric forms, angular shapes, and thoughtful spatial arrangement to suggest both rupture and order. I want this to feel like a museum-quality piece that could be exhibited alongside contemporary work exploring themes of entropy and structure. The composition should use a restrained palette (no more than 4 colors), employ minimal textual elements that function as visual architecture rather than explanation, and demonstrate the kind of painstaking craftsmanship that suggests countless hours of refinement by someone at the absolute top of their field. This should feel intellectually sophisticated - the kind of piece that rewards careful viewing and meditation on the tension between chaos and pattern.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A single-page visual artwork (PDF or PNG) is created that abstractly explores 'crystalline fragmentation' using geometric forms and spatial relationships rather than literal representations\n2. The composition uses a restrained color palette (4 colors or fewer) and demonstrates sophisticated visual balance between concepts of rupture and order\n3. Text is minimal and functions as visual architecture rather than explanation, with all elements properly contained within canvas boundaries without overlap\n4. The final work demonstrates museum-quality craftsmanship with meticulous attention to detail, looking like it required extensive refinement by an expert designer",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The canvas-design skill is selected to complete the task\n2. The SKILL.md file from the canvas-design skill is loaded and its instructions are followed, including creating a design philosophy document first\n3. Appropriate font files from the canvas-fonts directory are loaded and used in the composition to achieve sophisticated typography\n4. The skill is used appropriately by creating a visual philosophy document (.md), then expressing it through a refined visual composition (.pdf or .png) that emphasizes visual communication over text, demonstrates expert craftsmanship, and includes a second refinement pass as specified in the skill instructions",
