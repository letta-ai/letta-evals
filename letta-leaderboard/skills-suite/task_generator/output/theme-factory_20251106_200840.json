  "task": "I'm developing a heritage museum exhibition catalog for a new permanent collection focusing on ancient Egyptian artifacts and archaeological discoveries. The catalog will be distributed to museum patrons, academic researchers, and cultural heritage enthusiasts. I need the design to evoke a sense of timelessness, historical richness, and scholarly gravitas while remaining elegant and accessible. The color palette should reflect the golden sands of Egypt, the deep blues of lapis lazuli, and the warmth of ancient monuments, creating an atmosphere that honors both the antiquity and the cultural significance of these artifacts. The typography needs to balance academic credibility with visual beauty\u2014sophisticated enough for scholarly audiences but inviting for general museum visitors. The target audience includes history professors, museum curators, archaeology students, and cultured travelers aged 25-70 who appreciate historical preservation and ancient civilizations. Could you present me with various visual design directions featuring different color schemes and typography combinations that would be appropriate for this museum catalog context, and then help me implement the one that best captures that timeless, scholarly, and culturally respectful aesthetic?",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The agent displays or references the theme showcase PDF to present multiple visual design options to the user.\n2. The agent waits for and requests explicit user selection/confirmation of a preferred theme before proceeding with application.\n3. The agent loads and applies a specific theme (either pre-existing or custom-created) that appropriately matches the museum catalog context described (timeless, scholarly, golden/blue tones, elegant typography).\n4. The agent provides clear details about the selected theme's color palette and font pairings, explaining how they align with the ancient Egyptian heritage museum aesthetic requested.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent selects the theme-factory skill as relevant to completing this task.\n2. The agent loads the theme-factory/SKILL.md file to understand the workflow for applying themes to artifacts.\n3. The agent loads the theme-showcase.pdf file to display available options, and loads at least one theme file from the themes/ directory (such as golden-hour.md, midnight-galaxy.md, or desert-rose.md) or creates a custom theme with appropriate specifications.\n4. The agent follows the proper usage workflow: showing the showcase first, asking for theme selection, waiting for confirmation, and then applying the theme with complete specifications including hex codes and font pairings.",
