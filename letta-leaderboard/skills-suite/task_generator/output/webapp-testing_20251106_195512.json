  "task": "I have a React development server running on localhost:3000 that displays a todo list application. I need you to interact with it and verify its functionality. Specifically:\n\n1. Navigate to the application and capture a screenshot of the initial state\n2. Find and click the \"Add Task\" button\n3. Locate the text input field and enter \"Buy groceries\" as a new task\n4. Submit the form (look for a submit button or press Enter)\n5. Verify that the new task appears in the list by checking the page content\n6. Capture a final screenshot showing the task was added successfully\n7. Report any console errors or warnings that appeared during the interaction\n\nProvide me with both screenshots and a summary of whether the application behaved as expected. The server is already running and ready to accept connections.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. Two screenshots are captured and saved: one showing the initial application state and one showing the state after adding the task\n2. The automation script successfully navigates to localhost:3000, interacts with UI elements (button click, text input, and form submission) in the correct sequence\n3. The script verifies that \"Buy groceries\" appears in the DOM content after submission, confirming the task was added to the list\n4. A summary report is provided that includes the screenshot locations, describes what actions were performed, confirms whether the task appeared successfully, and lists any console errors or warnings encountered",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The webapp-testing skill is selected as the appropriate skill for this task\n2. The SKILL.md file from the webapp-testing skill is loaded to understand how to create Playwright automation scripts for testing web applications\n3. At least one example file (console_logging.py or element_discovery.py) is referenced or loaded to understand patterns for capturing console logs or discovering UI elements on the page\n4. The skill is used appropriately by creating a Playwright script that follows best practices: using sync_playwright(), waiting for networkidle before inspection, using the reconnaissance-then-action pattern to discover selectors, capturing screenshots, and properly closing the browser when done",
