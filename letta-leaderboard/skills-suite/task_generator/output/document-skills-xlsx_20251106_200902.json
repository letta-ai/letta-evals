  "task": "I'm analyzing our company's inventory turnover across multiple product categories. Here's the data:\n\n**Product Category A (Electronics):**\n- Beginning Inventory: $450,000\n- Ending Inventory: $520,000\n- Cost of Goods Sold: $2,340,000\n- Number of SKUs: 156\n\n**Product Category B (Home Goods):**\n- Beginning Inventory: $280,000\n- Ending Inventory: $315,000\n- Cost of Goods Sold: $1,680,000\n- Number of SKUs: 203\n\n**Product Category C (Apparel):**\n- Beginning Inventory: $620,000\n- Ending Inventory: $580,000\n- Cost of Goods Sold: $3,120,000\n- Number of SKUs: 487\n\n**Product Category D (Sports Equipment):**\n- Beginning Inventory: $385,000\n- Ending Inventory: $410,000\n- Cost of Goods Sold: $1,950,000\n- Number of SKUs: 124\n\n**Industry Benchmark Data:**\n- Target Inventory Turnover Ratio: 6.5x\n- Optimal Days Inventory Outstanding: 56 days\n- Target COGS per SKU: $8,000\n\nCreate a comprehensive inventory analysis workbook with the following sheets:\n\n1. **Inventory Data** sheet: Structure all the raw data in a clean table format with columns for Category, Beginning Inventory, Ending Inventory, COGS, and Number of SKUs. Include a separate section for the benchmark assumptions.\n\n2. **Turnover Analysis** sheet: Calculate for each category using formulas: Average Inventory ((Beginning + Ending)/2), Inventory Turnover Ratio (COGS/Average Inventory), Days Inventory Outstanding (365/Turnover Ratio), and COGS per SKU. Include totals across all categories where applicable.\n\n3. **Performance vs Benchmark** sheet: Compare each category's metrics against the benchmark targets. Calculate the variance from target for Turnover Ratio and Days Inventory Outstanding (both in absolute terms and as percentages). Use formulas to identify which category has the best and worst turnover performance using INDEX/MATCH or similar functions.\n\n4. **Efficiency Ranking** sheet: Rank all categories by their inventory turnover ratio using the RANK function. Calculate each category's percentage contribution to total company COGS and total average inventory. Include a metric showing inventory efficiency score calculated as (Actual Turnover Ratio / Target Turnover Ratio) * 100.\n\nAll calculations must be done with Excel formulas referencing appropriate cells - absolutely no hardcoded computed values. Apply proper financial formatting: currency should display with dollar signs and thousand separators with zeros as dashes, ratios should show one decimal place with an 'x' suffix (e.g., '6.5x'), and percentages should show one decimal place. Use color coding: blue text for input values in the benchmark section, black text for all formulas, and green text for cross-sheet references. Ensure the workbook has zero formula errors after recalculation.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The workbook contains exactly four sheets with the specified names (Inventory Data, Turnover Analysis, Performance vs Benchmark, Efficiency Ranking) and each sheet contains all required data and calculations as described in the task.\n2. All required metrics are calculated correctly using Excel formulas: Average Inventory, Inventory Turnover Ratio, Days Inventory Outstanding, COGS per SKU, variances from benchmarks, percentage contributions, and efficiency scores.\n3. The workbook uses appropriate Excel functions for identifying best/worst performers (INDEX/MATCH or similar) and ranking categories (RANK function), with all calculations referencing cells rather than containing hardcoded computed values.\n4. Proper formatting is applied throughout: currency with thousand separators and zeros as dashes, ratios with 'x' suffix showing one decimal place, percentages to one decimal place, and color coding follows the specified convention (blue for benchmark inputs, black for formulas, green for cross-sheet references).",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent correctly identifies and selects the document-skills/xlsx skill as the appropriate skill for creating a comprehensive spreadsheet with formulas, formatting, and data analysis.\n2. The agent loads and references the SKILL.md file from the document-skills/xlsx skill to understand the requirements for Excel file creation, formula construction, formatting standards, and error prevention.\n3. The agent loads and uses the recalc.py script to recalculate all formulas in the workbook and verify that there are zero formula errors in the final output.\n4. The agent appropriately applies the skill's guidance including: using openpyxl for formula-based spreadsheet creation, implementing proper financial formatting conventions, following color coding standards for different cell types, placing assumptions in separate cells, using cell references instead of hardcoded values in formulas, and running the recalc.py script to ensure all formulas calculate correctly with no errors.",
