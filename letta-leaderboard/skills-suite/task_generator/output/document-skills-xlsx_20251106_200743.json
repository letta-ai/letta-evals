  "task": "I need to analyze quarterly sales data and create a performance dashboard. Here's the raw data:\n\nQ1 2024: North region sold 15,000 units at $50/unit, South region sold 12,000 units at $50/unit, East region sold 18,000 units at $50/unit, West region sold 14,000 units at $50/unit.\n\nQ2 2024: North region sold 16,500 units at $52/unit, South region sold 13,200 units at $52/unit, East region sold 19,800 units at $52/unit, West region sold 15,400 units at $52/unit.\n\nQ3 2024: North region sold 18,150 units at $54/unit, South region sold 14,520 units at $54/unit, East region sold 21,780 units at $54/unit, West region sold 16,940 units at $54/unit.\n\nQ4 2024: North region sold 19,965 units at $56/unit, South region sold 15,972 units at $56/unit, East region sold 23,958 units at $56/unit, West region sold 18,634 units at $56/unit.\n\nCreate a comprehensive Excel workbook with the following:\n\n1. A 'Raw Data' sheet with all the quarterly data organized in a table format (columns: Quarter, Region, Units Sold, Price per Unit)\n\n2. A 'Revenue Analysis' sheet that calculates:\n   - Revenue for each region in each quarter using formulas (not hardcoded calculations)\n   - Total revenue by quarter\n   - Total revenue by region across all quarters\n   - Quarter-over-quarter growth rate for each region\n   - Overall annual totals\n\n3. A 'Performance Metrics' sheet showing:\n   - Each region's percentage contribution to total annual revenue\n   - Average quarterly revenue per region\n   - The highest and lowest performing quarter for each region (using formulas to identify)\n   - Year-over-year unit growth rate by region (comparing Q4 to Q1)\n\nAll calculations must use Excel formulas referencing the appropriate cells - no hardcoded values. Apply proper formatting: currency values should show dollar signs with thousand separators, percentages should show one decimal place, and all zeros should display as dashes. Use appropriate text colors for different types of data (inputs vs formulas vs cross-sheet references). Ensure the workbook has zero formula errors after recalculation.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The Excel workbook contains three separate sheets ('Raw Data', 'Revenue Analysis', 'Performance Metrics') with the quarterly sales data organized correctly in the Raw Data sheet with columns for Quarter, Region, Units Sold, and Price per Unit.\n2. The Revenue Analysis sheet contains formulas that calculate revenue (units \u00d7 price), totals by quarter and region, quarter-over-quarter growth rates, and annual totals - all using cell references rather than hardcoded calculations.\n3. The Performance Metrics sheet uses formulas to calculate percentage contributions, averages, identify highest/lowest quarters, and compute growth rates, with all calculations properly referencing data from other sheets.\n4. The workbook applies proper formatting including currency with thousand separators and dollar signs, percentages with one decimal place, zeros displayed as dashes, and uses color coding for different data types (blue for inputs, black for formulas, green for cross-sheet links), with zero formula errors present in the final file.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent correctly identifies and selects the 'xlsx' skill as appropriate for creating and working with spreadsheet files containing formulas and formatting.\n2. The agent loads the SKILL.md file from the xlsx skill to access instructions on spreadsheet creation, formula usage, formatting standards, and recalculation procedures.\n3. The agent loads and uses the recalc.py script to recalculate all formulas in the workbook and verify there are no formula errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.).\n4. The agent appropriately applies the skill's guidelines including: using openpyxl for creating the workbook with formulas and formatting, implementing Excel formulas instead of Python-calculated hardcoded values, following the color coding standards (blue for inputs, black for formulas, green for cross-sheet references), applying number formatting conventions (currency format, zeros as dashes, percentages with decimals), running the recalc.py script after creating the file, and verifying zero formula errors in the output.",
