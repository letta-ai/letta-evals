  "task": "I run a small consulting business and we frequently perform financial health assessments for small businesses. The process involves: (1) Analyzing balance sheets and income statements to calculate key financial ratios (current ratio, debt-to-equity, profit margin, ROE), (2) Comparing these ratios against industry benchmarks to identify red flags, (3) Generating a standardized assessment report with our company letterhead and formatting, and (4) Providing actionable recommendations based on the findings. I've already developed a Python script that calculates all the financial ratios correctly from CSV input files, and I have our standard report template in Markdown format that shows exactly how we structure our findings. I also have documentation about the industry benchmark ranges we use for different business sectors (retail, manufacturing, services). I need to package all of this together into something I can share with the two junior consultants I just hired, so they can execute these assessments consistently without constantly asking me questions. The package should include the calculation script, the report template, the benchmark documentation, and clear step-by-step instructions on the complete workflow from receiving client data to delivering the final report. Once it's created, I need it properly validated and packaged so I can distribute it to my team.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The agent initializes a new skill directory using the init_skill.py script with an appropriate skill name related to financial assessment or business analysis.\n2. The agent creates or includes a Python script in the scripts/ directory for calculating financial ratios, a report template in the assets/ or references/ directory, and benchmark documentation in the references/ directory.\n3. The agent writes comprehensive SKILL.md content that describes the purpose, when to use it, and how to use each component (calculation script, report template, and benchmark documentation) in the financial assessment workflow.\n4. The agent validates and packages the completed skill using the package_skill.py script, producing a distributable zip file.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent selects the skill-creator skill as the appropriate skill for this task.\n2. The agent loads the skill-creator/SKILL.md file to access the skill creation guidance and workflow.\n3. The agent loads and uses all three scripts from the skill-creator/scripts/ directory: init_skill.py to initialize the skill structure, package_skill.py to create the distributable package, and references quick_validate.py if needed for validation.\n4. The agent follows the skill creation process outlined in SKILL.md, including understanding the concrete example, planning reusable contents (scripts, references, assets), initializing the skill, editing SKILL.md with proper structure and imperative language, and packaging the final skill.",
