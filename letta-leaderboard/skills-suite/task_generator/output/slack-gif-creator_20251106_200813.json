  "task": "Create an animated GIF for Slack messages that shows a coffee cup filling up and steaming. The animation should start with an empty coffee cup at the bottom center of the frame. Then, coffee should appear to pour into the cup from above, filling it up gradually over about 1 second. Once the cup is full, add rising steam particles that drift upward and fade out. The steam should continue for another 1-2 seconds, creating a cozy, warm feeling. Make the coffee a rich brown color and the cup white or cream colored. The animation should be optimized for Slack messages (around 480x480 pixels) and stay well under 2MB. Add a subtle background color that complements the coffee theme. Make sure the animation loops smoothly so the cup appears to empty and refill continuously. Verify the final file meets Slack's size requirements for message GIFs.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The GIF shows a coffee cup that starts empty and gradually fills with coffee liquid over approximately 1 second, with visible pouring animation.\n2. Steam particles are animated rising upward from the filled coffee cup and fading out, continuing for 1-2 seconds after the cup fills.\n3. The GIF uses appropriate colors (brown coffee, white/cream cup) with a complementary background, is sized around 480x480 pixels, and loops smoothly.\n4. The final GIF file is verified to be under 2MB and meets Slack's message GIF requirements, with confirmation provided.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent identifies and selects the slack-gif-creator skill as the appropriate tool for creating an animated GIF optimized for Slack.\n2. The agent loads and references the slack-gif-creator/SKILL.md file to understand GIF creation requirements and available tools.\n3. The agent loads and uses relevant additional files including core/gif_builder.py, core/validators.py, core/visual_effects.py (for particle system/steam), core/frame_composer.py (for drawing elements), and core/easing.py (for smooth filling animation).\n4. The agent appropriately uses the skill's components including GIFBuilder for assembly, validators to check Slack size constraints, visual effects ParticleSystem for steam, frame composition utilities for drawing the cup and coffee, and easing functions for smooth liquid filling animation, with proper validation of the final output against message GIF requirements.",
