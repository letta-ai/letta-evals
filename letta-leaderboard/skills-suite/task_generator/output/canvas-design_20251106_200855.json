  "task": "I need you to create a sophisticated single-page abstract visual artwork that explores the philosophical concept of 'entropic decay' - the idea that all ordered systems gradually dissolve into chaos, yet leave traces of their former structure. This should NOT be literal imagery of rust, crumbling buildings, or deteriorating objects. Instead, I want an abstract composition that uses geometric forms in various states of dissolution - perhaps shapes that are crisp on one edge but fragment into smaller particles on another, or patterns that begin organized and systematically break down across the canvas. The piece should evoke the tension between order and entropy through visual language alone: maybe through gradients of density (from solid forms to dispersed elements), through color shifts (from saturated to desaturated), or through the breakdown of repetitive patterns. I'm looking for museum-quality work with a restrained palette (maximum 4 colors), minimal textual elements functioning as visual architecture rather than explanation, and craftsmanship that demonstrates absolute mastery - the kind of piece that appears to have required weeks of refinement by someone at the peak of their profession. This should feel intellectually sophisticated, like it belongs in a contemporary art exhibition on thermodynamics and time, rewarding sustained contemplation of how visual systems can express the second law of thermodynamics through pure design.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A design philosophy document (.md file) is created that articulates a visual movement focused on expressing entropic decay through abstract forms, spanning 4-6 substantial paragraphs with emphasis on visual expression, spatial communication, and minimal text.\n2. A single-page visual artwork (.pdf or .png) is produced that explores entropic decay through abstract geometric forms showing progression from order to chaos, without literal depictions of rust, crumbling, or deteriorating objects.\n3. The artwork employs a restrained color palette (maximum 4 colors) and demonstrates the concept through visual elements such as forms dissolving from solid to fragmented, density gradients, pattern breakdown, or color transitions from saturated to desaturated.\n4. The composition demonstrates museum-quality craftsmanship with sophisticated spatial relationships, precise execution, minimal textual elements (if any) that function as visual architecture, and overall appears meticulously refined to professional exhibition standards.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The canvas-design skill is correctly identified and selected as the appropriate skill for creating abstract visual artwork with design philosophy.\n2. The canvas-design skill's SKILL.md file is loaded into the context to access instructions for design philosophy creation and canvas creation.\n3. Font files from the canvas-fonts directory are accessed and appropriately used in the composition to achieve sophisticated typography that enhances the visual design.\n4. The skill is used appropriately by following the two-step process (design philosophy creation followed by visual expression), emphasizing visual communication over text, maintaining sophistication and craftsmanship, ensuring all elements stay within canvas boundaries without overlap, and creating work that appears meticulously crafted by an expert at the top of their field.",
