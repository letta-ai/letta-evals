  "task": "I need to create a reusable package for our finance team that helps analyze and visualize stock portfolio data. We regularly receive CSV files with columns: ticker, shares, purchase_price, current_price, purchase_date. The workflow we need is: (1) Calculate portfolio metrics including total value, gain/loss per position, percentage returns, and overall portfolio performance, (2) Generate risk analysis showing position concentration and diversification metrics, (3) Create visualizations including a pie chart of portfolio allocation and a bar chart of top gainers/losers, and (4) Export a formatted summary report. I have a Python script I've been maintaining that correctly calculates all the financial metrics using our firm's specific formulas (like weighted average cost basis and annualized returns), and I also have a detailed reference document explaining our risk thresholds (no single position should exceed 15% of portfolio, minimum 8 positions for diversification) and reporting standards. I want to bundle everything together - the calculation script, the risk guidelines document, and clear step-by-step instructions - so any team member or AI assistant can execute this analysis consistently. The package needs to be properly structured, validated to ensure it meets all requirements, and packaged into a distributable format I can share with the entire finance department.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The skill is initialized with proper directory structure including SKILL.md with required YAML frontmatter (name and description fields), and appropriate subdirectories for resources.\n2. A Python script for portfolio calculations is created or referenced in the scripts/ directory, and a reference document about risk thresholds and reporting standards is created or referenced in the references/ directory.\n3. The SKILL.md file contains clear instructions written in imperative/infinitive form covering: the skill's purpose, when to use it, and how to use the bundled resources (the calculation script and risk guidelines document) to complete the portfolio analysis workflow.\n4. The skill is validated and packaged into a distributable zip file using the packaging script, with all validation checks passing successfully.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The skill-creator skill is correctly identified as the appropriate skill for creating a reusable package with scripts, references, and documentation.\n2. The skill-creator SKILL.md file is loaded and referenced to guide the skill creation process, following the documented steps (understanding examples, planning contents, initializing, editing, packaging).\n3. The init_skill.py script is executed to initialize the skill structure, and the package_skill.py script is executed to validate and package the final skill into a distributable format.\n4. The skill creation follows the progressive disclosure principle with appropriate separation of resources (scripts/ for the calculation code, references/ for the risk guidelines, SKILL.md for workflow instructions), uses imperative/infinitive writing style, and includes proper YAML frontmatter with descriptive metadata.",
