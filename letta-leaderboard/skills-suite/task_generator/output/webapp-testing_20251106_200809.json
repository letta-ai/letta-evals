  "task": "I have two local servers that need to work together: a Python Flask API backend running on port 5000 and a frontend dashboard running on port 8080. The frontend makes API calls to the backend to fetch user statistics.\n\nI need you to:\n1. Start both servers simultaneously (the backend server command is 'python api_server.py' and the frontend server command is 'npm start --port 8080')\n2. Navigate to the frontend dashboard at localhost:8080\n3. Wait for the page to fully load and capture an initial screenshot\n4. Find and click the button labeled 'Load Statistics' which triggers an API call to the backend\n5. Wait for the statistics data to appear on the page (it should display in a section with id='stats-display')\n6. Capture a second screenshot showing the loaded statistics\n7. Extract the text content from the stats-display section to verify what data was retrieved\n8. Monitor and report any console errors or network failures that occurred during the API call\n\nBoth servers need to be running before the automation begins, and the frontend depends on the backend being available. Provide me with both screenshots, the statistics data that was displayed, and confirmation that the frontend-backend communication worked correctly.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. Two screenshots are provided: one showing the initial state of the frontend dashboard, and another showing the statistics after clicking the 'Load Statistics' button\n2. The text content extracted from the 'stats-display' section is reported, demonstrating that data was successfully retrieved from the backend API\n3. Console logs or errors are captured and reported, specifically noting whether any network failures or API communication issues occurred\n4. A clear confirmation is provided about whether the frontend-backend integration worked correctly, including whether the statistics loaded successfully after clicking the button",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The webapp-testing skill is selected to handle the multi-server web application testing task\n2. The webapp-testing/SKILL.md file is loaded to access guidance on managing multiple servers and writing Playwright automation scripts\n3. The scripts/with_server.py helper script is used (with --help first) to manage the lifecycle of both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously, as indicated by the multiple --server and --port flags\n4. A Playwright automation script is written that properly waits for networkidle before inspection, uses appropriate selectors to find the 'Load Statistics' button and stats-display section, captures screenshots at the correct moments, extracts text content, and monitors console output for errors",
