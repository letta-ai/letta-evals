  "task": "I'm analyzing investment opportunities and need to create a DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) valuation model. Here are the projections for TechCorp:\n\n**Historical & Projected Financials:**\n- Revenue (millions): 2023: $450, 2024: $540, 2025: $648, 2026: $778, 2027: $933, 2028: $1,120\n- EBITDA Margin: Currently 18% in 2023, improving 200 basis points per year to reach 26% by 2028\n- D&A as % of Revenue: 5% annually\n- CapEx as % of Revenue: 6% annually\n- Change in Net Working Capital: 3% of revenue growth each year\n- Tax Rate: 21%\n\n**Valuation Assumptions:**\n- WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital): 12%\n- Terminal Growth Rate: 3%\n- Net Debt: $125 million\n- Shares Outstanding: 50 million\n\nCreate a comprehensive DCF model with the following components:\n\n1. **Projections Sheet**: Build out full 6-year projections (2023-2028) showing Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT (EBITDA - D&A), NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax), plus Unlevered Free Cash Flow calculated as NOPAT + D&A - CapEx - Change in NWC\n\n2. **DCF Valuation Sheet**: Calculate the present value of each year's FCF using the WACC discount factor, sum to get PV of projected cash flows, calculate Terminal Value using the perpetuity growth method (Final Year FCF \u00d7 (1 + Terminal Growth Rate) / (WACC - Terminal Growth Rate)), discount Terminal Value to present, sum Enterprise Value, subtract Net Debt to get Equity Value, and divide by shares to get Price per Share\n\n3. **Sensitivity Analysis Sheet**: Create a two-way sensitivity table showing how the implied share price changes with different WACC assumptions (rows: 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%) and Terminal Growth Rate assumptions (columns: 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%)\n\nAll assumptions must be in a clearly labeled assumptions section with blue text. All calculations must use formulas referencing assumption cells - never hardcode rates or percentages directly into calculation formulas. Apply proper financial modeling conventions: currency in millions with '$XXXmm' notation, percentages to one decimal, WACC and terminal growth as percentages, zeros displayed as dashes, and negative cash flows in parentheses. The model must have zero formula errors after recalculation.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The workbook contains three sheets (Projections, DCF Valuation, and Sensitivity Analysis) with all required financial calculations including Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, NOPAT, and Unlevered Free Cash Flow for years 2023-2028\n2. The DCF Valuation sheet correctly calculates present values of cash flows, Terminal Value using the perpetuity growth method, Enterprise Value, Equity Value, and Price per Share with proper discounting formulas\n3. The Sensitivity Analysis sheet contains a complete two-way data table showing share price variations across the specified WACC range (10%-14%) and Terminal Growth Rate range (2.0%-4.0%)\n4. All key assumptions (EBITDA margin progression, D&A %, CapEx %, NWC %, Tax Rate, WACC, Terminal Growth Rate, Net Debt, Shares Outstanding) are placed in a dedicated assumptions section and referenced by formulas rather than hardcoded into calculations",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The assistant correctly identifies and selects the 'document-skills/xlsx' skill as appropriate for creating a complex financial DCF valuation model with formulas and formatting\n2. The assistant loads and references the SKILL.md file to understand Excel creation workflows, formula requirements, and financial modeling conventions\n3. The assistant uses the recalc.py script to recalculate all formulas and verify zero formula errors in the completed workbook\n4. The assistant properly applies the skill's guidelines including: using Excel formulas instead of hardcoded calculations, implementing financial model color coding standards (blue for inputs, black for formulas), applying proper number formatting (currency with units, zeros as dashes, percentages to one decimal), and ensuring the workbook passes recalculation with zero errors",
