  "task": "I manage a small e-commerce analytics team and we regularly analyze customer behavior data from our online store. Our typical workflow involves: (1) Reading CSV files containing customer purchase data (columns: customer_id, order_date, product_category, revenue, discount_applied), (2) Calculating customer lifetime value (CLV) and segmenting customers into tiers (Bronze: CLV < $500, Silver: $500-$2000, Gold: > $2000), (3) Identifying purchasing patterns like average order frequency and preferred product categories per segment, and (4) Generating a formatted business intelligence report with visualizations showing segment distribution and revenue contribution. I've developed a reliable Python script that performs the CLV calculations and customer segmentation using our company's specific formulas (CLV = sum of all revenue * 1.2 adjustment factor for projected future value). I also have a comprehensive reference document that explains our segmentation strategy, benchmark metrics for healthy customer distribution (ideal: 60% Bronze, 30% Silver, 10% Gold), and guidelines for when to trigger retention campaigns. Additionally, I have a report template in Markdown format that shows our standard BI report structure with sections for Executive Summary, Segment Analysis, and Recommendations. I need to bundle all of these components - the calculation script, the segmentation strategy document, the report template, and complete workflow instructions - into something that any analyst on my team can use to execute these assessments consistently. The bundle needs to be properly structured with all components organized logically, thoroughly validated to ensure it meets professional standards, and packaged into a distributable format that I can share across my analytics team. Walk me through creating this from the ground up.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. Initialize a new skill directory using the init_skill.py script with an appropriate name related to e-commerce or customer analytics\n2. Create or populate the required bundled resources: a Python script for CLV calculation in scripts/, a reference document for segmentation strategy in references/, and a Markdown report template in assets/\n3. Update the SKILL.md file with proper YAML frontmatter (name and description), purpose statement, usage guidance, and instructions on how to use each bundled resource (script, reference doc, and template)\n4. Validate and package the skill using package_skill.py script to create a distributable zip file",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The skill-creator skill is selected as the appropriate skill for this task\n2. The skill-creator/SKILL.md file is loaded to access the skill creation process and guidelines\n3. All three scripts from skill-creator/scripts/ are loaded and used: init_skill.py for initialization, package_skill.py for packaging, and quick_validate.py is available if needed for validation\n4. The skill creation process from SKILL.md is followed systematically: understanding the concrete example (Step 1), planning reusable contents identifying scripts/references/assets (Step 2), initializing with init_skill.py (Step 3), editing the skill with proper structure and bundled resources (Step 4), and packaging with package_skill.py (Step 5)",
