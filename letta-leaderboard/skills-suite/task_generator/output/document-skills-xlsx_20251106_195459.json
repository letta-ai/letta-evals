  "task": "Create a 3-year financial projection model for a SaaS startup that is currently generating $2M in annual recurring revenue (ARR) with 80% gross margins. The model should include: (1) A Revenue tab with monthly projections showing 10% month-over-month growth for Year 1, 8% for Year 2, and 6% for Year 3, (2) An Expenses tab tracking Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) at 20% of revenue, Sales & Marketing at 40% of revenue in Year 1 decreasing to 35% by Year 3, and General & Administrative expenses starting at $500K annually growing 15% per year, (3) A P&L Summary tab that pulls from the other tabs and calculates monthly EBITDA and cumulative cash burn. All assumptions (growth rates, expense percentages, etc.) must be in separate clearly labeled cells, not hardcoded in formulas. Use proper financial model formatting conventions including color-coding for inputs versus formulas, appropriate number formatting with currency showing millions (e.g., '$2.5mm'), and ensuring all zeros display as dashes. The model must have zero formula errors and all formulas must be properly calculated.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The spreadsheet contains three separate tabs (Revenue, Expenses, and P&L Summary) with the specified structure and monthly projections spanning 3 years (36 months).\n2. All growth rates, margin percentages, and other assumptions are placed in separate labeled assumption cells and referenced in formulas rather than hardcoded as values.\n3. The P&L Summary tab correctly pulls data from the Revenue and Expenses tabs using cross-sheet formulas and calculates EBITDA and cumulative cash burn for each month.\n4. The spreadsheet uses proper financial formatting including appropriate color-coding (blue for inputs, black for formulas, green for cross-sheet references), currency formatted to show millions with units in headers, zeros displayed as dashes, and contains zero formula errors after recalculation.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent selects the 'document-skills/xlsx' skill as relevant to the task.\n2. The agent loads and references the SKILL.md file from the 'document-skills/xlsx' skill directory.\n3. The agent loads or uses the recalc.py script to recalculate formulas and verify there are no errors in the final spreadsheet.\n4. The agent appropriately uses openpyxl to create the Excel file with formulas (not hardcoded values), applies the color-coding standards and number formatting rules specified in the skill documentation, and runs the recalc.py script to ensure all formulas are calculated and error-free.",
