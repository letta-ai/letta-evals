  "task": "I want to build a modular capability that will help me work with SQLite databases. Specifically, I need to be able to query databases, create new tables, insert data, and analyze database schemas. I often find myself rewriting the same SQL connection code and schema discovery queries. I'd like something reusable that includes a Python script for common database operations and documentation about best practices for different types of queries (SELECT, JOIN, aggregations, etc.). Can you help me create this as a reusable package with proper structure, validation, and distribution format?",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The agent must create a complete capability package with proper directory structure including a main markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing name and description fields.\n2. The package must include at least one Python script in a scripts directory that handles SQLite database operations (querying, table creation, data insertion, schema analysis).\n3. The package must include reference documentation in a references directory covering SQL query best practices and patterns.\n4. The agent must validate and package the capability into a distributable zip file using the appropriate packaging process.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent must identify and select the skill-creator skill as the appropriate skill for this task.\n2. The agent must load the skill-creator SKILL.md file to understand the skill creation process and structure requirements.\n3. The agent must use the init_skill.py script to initialize the skill structure and the package_skill.py script to validate and package the final result.\n4. The agent must follow the documented skill creation process including understanding requirements, planning reusable contents, initializing the skill structure, editing SKILL.md with imperative language, and packaging the final deliverable.",
