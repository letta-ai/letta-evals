  "task": "I need to create a comprehensive invoice system. First, generate a password-protected invoice PDF that includes: a header with 'INVOICE #2024-001' rotated 90 degrees clockwise in the top-right corner, an itemized table with columns for Item, Quantity, Price, and Total containing at least 3 products, a subtotal section, and a footer with payment terms. The document should be encrypted with the password 'Invoice2024'. Then, create a second PDF that merges this invoice with a separate terms and conditions page (which you should also create, containing standard payment terms of Net 30 days). Finally, extract all the text from the merged document and provide a summary showing: the total number of pages, the invoice number, all line items with their totals, and the payment terms. The invoice should include these items: 'Consulting Services' (10 hours at $150/hour), 'Software License' (1 unit at $500), and 'Support Package' (1 unit at $200).",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A password-protected PDF invoice is created containing a rotated header with 'INVOICE #2024-001', an itemized table with the three specified items and their correct calculations (Consulting: $1500, Software: $500, Support: $200), and payment terms\n2. A second PDF is created that merges the invoice with a separate terms and conditions page, resulting in a multi-page document\n3. Text extraction is performed on the merged document, successfully retrieving content from both pages\n4. A summary is provided that includes the total page count (2 pages), the invoice number (2024-001), all line items with correct totals, and the payment terms (Net 30 days)",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The document-skills/pdf skill is selected as the primary skill for this task\n2. The SKILL.md file is loaded to access PDF creation, manipulation, encryption, merging, rotation, and text extraction capabilities\n3. The skill is appropriately used to: (a) create PDFs using reportlab, (b) rotate pages using pypdf, (c) encrypt the PDF with password protection using pypdf, (d) merge multiple PDFs using pypdf, and (e) extract text content using pdfplumber or pypdf\n4. No additional files from the skill directory need to be loaded as this task involves standard PDF operations covered in SKILL.md (forms.md would only be needed for fillable form fields, and reference.md for advanced features not required here)",
