  "task": "I'm preparing a quarterly business review presentation and want it to have a sophisticated, professional look that conveys trust and stability. The presentation covers financial performance, market analysis, and strategic initiatives. I'd like to see a range of visual styling options that would work well for a corporate executive audience, then apply the one that best matches a calm, trustworthy, and professional aesthetic. The color scheme should inspire confidence without being too bold or flashy, and the typography should be clean and highly readable.",

The assistant explicitly asks the user to select a preferred styling option and waits for user confirmation before proceeding.\n3. The assistant applies a theme that matches the described requirements: calm, trustworthy, professional aesthetic suitable for corporate executives with colors that inspire confidence and clean, readable typography.\n4. The assistant provides clear information about the selected theme including its color palette (with hex codes) and font pairings that will be applied to the presentation.",
