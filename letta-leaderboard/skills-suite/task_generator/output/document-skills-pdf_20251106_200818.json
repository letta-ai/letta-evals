  "task": "I need to create a legal contract template system with multiple versions. Here's what I need:\n\n1. Create an original 4-page employment contract document with:\n   - Page 1: Title 'EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT' centered at top, followed by 'This Agreement is entered into on March 1, 2024, between TechVentures Inc. (\"Employer\") and John Smith (\"Employee\")' and a brief introduction paragraph\n   - Page 2: Section titled 'TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT' with 3 paragraphs covering position, duties, and work location\n   - Page 3: Section titled 'COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS' with a table showing: Base Salary ($95,000), Annual Bonus (Up to 15%), Health Insurance (Full Coverage), Vacation Days (20 days)\n   - Page 4: Section titled 'TERMINATION CLAUSE' with 2 paragraphs explaining notice periods and conditions\n\n2. From this original document, create two separate versions by splitting:\n   - Pages 1-2 as 'contract_intro.pdf'\n   - Pages 3-4 as 'contract_terms.pdf'\n\n3. Create a second employee contract by taking 'contract_intro.pdf' and replacing 'John Smith' with 'Maria Garcia' throughout the document. Save this as 'contract_intro_garcia.pdf'\n\n4. Now rotate page 1 of 'contract_intro_garcia.pdf' by 270 degrees (counter-clockwise) and save as 'contract_intro_garcia_rotated.pdf'\n\n5. Extract the complete text from both 'contract_intro_garcia_rotated.pdf' and 'contract_terms.pdf', then merge them together to create a new complete contract saved as 'contract_garcia_final.pdf'\n\n6. Extract the compensation table from page 3 of 'contract_garcia_final.pdf' and display it in a structured format\n\n7. Apply password protection to 'contract_garcia_final.pdf' with the password 'Contract2024Secure!' and save as 'contract_garcia_protected.pdf'\n\n8. Extract and display the metadata from 'contract_garcia_protected.pdf' (including total pages and any document properties)\n\nProvide confirmation of each step, the extracted table data from step 6, and the metadata from step 8.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. Four separate PDF documents are created with correct naming: contract_intro.pdf, contract_terms.pdf, contract_intro_garcia.pdf (or contract_intro_garcia_rotated.pdf), and contract_garcia_final.pdf (and contract_garcia_protected.pdf)\n2. The original 4-page document is properly split into two parts, one version has text replacement (John Smith \u2192 Maria Garcia), and includes a rotation operation followed by merging\n3. The compensation table from page 3 is extracted and displayed showing all four rows with their values (Base Salary, Annual Bonus, Health Insurance, Vacation Days)\n4. Password protection is applied to the final document and metadata is extracted and displayed, confirming the document has 4 pages and showing any available document properties",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The document-skills/pdf skill is selected and identified as relevant for the task\n2. The SKILL.md file from the document-skills/pdf skill is loaded into the context to access PDF manipulation instructions\n3. No additional files from the skill directory need to be loaded since the task involves basic PDF operations (creation, splitting, merging, rotation, text extraction, password protection) covered in SKILL.md, not form filling or advanced features\n4. The skill's tools and techniques are used appropriately: pypdf or reportlab for PDF creation, pypdf for splitting/merging/rotation/password protection, and pdfplumber or pypdf for text and table extraction as documented in SKILL.md",
