  "task": "Create an animated GIF for our team Slack that shows a celebration sequence. Start with a party popper emoji (\ud83c\udf89) positioned in the center-left of the frame. The popper should slide in from the left edge with a slight overshoot effect, pause briefly in position, then explode with colorful confetti particles bursting outward in multiple directions. The confetti should have varied colors (red, blue, yellow, green, purple) and should arc outward realistically before falling down due to gravity. After the explosion, add the text 'SHIPPED!' that fades in at the top of the frame with a subtle pulse effect. The entire animation should be suitable for posting in Slack message threads, so make it approximately 480x480 pixels and ensure it stays well under 2MB. The animation should be around 3 seconds total and loop smoothly. Use a light, celebratory background color. Before finishing, verify that the final file meets the size requirements for Slack message GIFs.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The GIF shows a complete celebration sequence with a party popper emoji that slides in from the left with overshoot, followed by an explosion effect with colorful confetti particles that move realistically with varied trajectories.\n2. The text 'SHIPPED!' appears after the explosion, implemented with a fade-in effect and subtle pulse animation as specified.\n3. The GIF is optimized for Slack messages with dimensions around 480x480 pixels, duration of approximately 3 seconds, and file size verified to be under 2MB.\n4. The animation uses a light, celebratory background color and loops smoothly from end to beginning, with all motion effects (slide with overshoot, explosion, particle physics, fade, pulse) properly implemented.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The slack-gif-creator skill is identified and selected as the appropriate skill for creating an animated GIF optimized for Slack.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the slack-gif-creator skill is loaded to understand the toolkit structure, constraints, and available components.\n3. Multiple necessary files are loaded and used appropriately: core/gif_builder.py for GIF assembly, core/validators.py for Slack size verification, templates/slide.py for the slide-in motion with overshoot, templates/explode.py for the explosion effect, core/visual_effects.py for particle system and confetti, templates/fade.py for text fade-in, templates/pulse.py for text pulsing, core/typography.py for text rendering with outline, and core/easing.py for smooth motion interpolation.\n4. The skill components are used appropriately by composing multiple animation primitives (slide, explode, fade, pulse) together, implementing particle physics for realistic confetti motion, validating against Slack's message GIF constraints (2MB limit, 480x480 dimensions), and using the GIF builder with proper optimization settings for the target use case.",
