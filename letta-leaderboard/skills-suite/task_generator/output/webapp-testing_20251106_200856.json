  "task": "I'm working on a local single-page application that has a dynamic search feature. The app runs on port 4200 using the command 'ng serve --port 4200' from the /home/user/search-app directory.\n\nThe application has the following features:\n- A search input box with placeholder text \"Search products...\"\n- A search button labeled \"Search\"\n- A results container that initially shows \"No results yet\"\n- When you search for \"laptop\", it should display 3 product cards with names, prices, and \"Add to Cart\" buttons\n- Each product card has a class \"product-card\"\n- There's a shopping cart counter badge at the top right that shows the number of items in the cart\n\nI need you to:\n1. Start the Angular development server and navigate to http://localhost:4200\n2. Take a screenshot of the initial empty state before any search\n3. Type \"laptop\" into the search input field\n4. Click the search button and wait for the results to load (they load via an API call)\n5. Take a screenshot showing the search results with all product cards visible\n6. Count how many product cards are displayed and verify there are exactly 3\n7. Click the \"Add to Cart\" button on the second product card\n8. Wait for the cart counter badge to update\n9. Take a final screenshot showing the updated cart counter\n10. Extract and report the cart counter value to confirm it shows \"1\"\n11. Capture and report any console errors or warnings that occurred during the entire interaction\n\nProvide all three screenshots, confirmation of the product count, the cart counter value, and a summary of any console messages. The server needs to be fully started before the automation begins.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. Three screenshots are provided: initial state, search results with product cards, and final state with updated cart counter\n2. The automation successfully searches for \"laptop\", waits for results to load, and verifies that exactly 3 product cards are displayed\n3. The \"Add to Cart\" button on the second product is clicked and the cart counter value is extracted and confirmed to be \"1\"\n4. Console logs/errors are captured and reported, along with a summary of whether the search and cart functionality worked correctly",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The webapp-testing skill is selected to handle the task of starting a local server and automating browser interactions\n2. The SKILL.md file from webapp-testing is loaded to understand how to use with_server.py and write Playwright automation scripts\n3. Additional example files (console_logging.py and/or element_discovery.py) are referenced or loaded to understand patterns for capturing console output and discovering elements on dynamic pages\n4. The with_server.py script is used correctly to manage the Angular server lifecycle, and a Playwright script is written that follows best practices including waiting for networkidle, using appropriate selectors, taking screenshots at each step, and capturing console messages",
