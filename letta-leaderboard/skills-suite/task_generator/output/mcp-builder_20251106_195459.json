  "task": "I need help building a Python-based integration that allows AI assistants to interact with the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). This is a fake REST API for testing that provides endpoints for posts, comments, albums, photos, todos, and users.\n\nI want to create a server that exposes tools for:\n1. Searching posts by user ID or title keywords\n2. Getting comments for a specific post\n3. Retrieving user information by ID or username\n4. Listing todos for a user, with filtering by completion status\n\nThe tools should return results in both JSON and Markdown formats, handle pagination properly (the API supports _limit and _page query parameters), and provide clear error messages when things go wrong. Each tool should have comprehensive documentation that explains what it does, what parameters it accepts, and examples of when to use it.\n\nAfter building the server, create a set of 10 test questions that would verify an AI assistant can effectively use these tools to answer complex queries about the fake data. For example, questions that require combining multiple tool calls or exploring the data to find specific information.\n\nPlease build this following best practices for this type of integration, including proper input validation, error handling, and response formatting.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A complete Python server implementation is provided that includes at least 4 tools corresponding to the requested functionality (searching posts, getting comments, retrieving user info, listing todos with filtering)\n2. Each tool includes comprehensive documentation with parameter descriptions, examples, and implements both JSON and Markdown response formats with proper input validation (using Pydantic models)\n3. The implementation includes shared utility functions for API requests, error handling, pagination support, and response formatting to avoid code duplication\n4. An evaluation file is created containing exactly 10 question-answer pairs in XML format that test the server's tools through realistic, complex queries requiring multiple tool calls",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The mcp-builder skill is explicitly selected and loaded to address the task of building a Python-based integration server\n2. The SKILL.md file for the mcp-builder skill is loaded and referenced to understand the four-phase workflow (research, implementation, review, evaluation)\n3. Additional reference files are loaded as needed during the workflow, including the MCP best practices guide, Python implementation guide, and evaluation guide as specified in the skill documentation\n4. The implementation follows the structured phases outlined in the skill, including API research, comprehensive planning with tool selection and error handling strategy, systematic implementation using Pydantic models and proper tool registration, code quality review, and creation of evaluation questions following the evaluation guide's requirements",
