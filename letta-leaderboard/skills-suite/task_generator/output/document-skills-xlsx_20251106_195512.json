  "task": "I need help creating a 3-statement financial model for a SaaS company. Here are the details:\n\nRevenue starts at $10M in Year 1 and grows at 25% annually for 5 years. Cost of Revenue is 20% of revenue. Operating expenses are: Sales & Marketing (40% of revenue), R&D (25% of revenue), and G&A (15% of revenue). The company has $5M in cash at the start, no debt, and pays 25% tax rate on positive income.\n\nCreate an integrated 3-statement model with:\n1. Income Statement (Revenue through Net Income)\n2. Balance Sheet (Assets, Liabilities, Equity)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Operating, Investing, Financing activities)\n\nAll statements should be linked with formulas - no hardcoded calculations. Include proper assumptions section with growth rates and margin assumptions in separate cells that feed into the model. Make sure the Balance Sheet balances each year and Cash flows properly link to the Balance Sheet. Apply standard financial modeling color coding (blue for inputs, black for formulas, green for cross-sheet links) and formatting conventions (currency with units specified, zeros as dashes, negatives in parentheses).",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The Excel file contains three properly structured financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement) with revenue starting at $10M and all specified expense categories and percentages correctly represented.\n2. All financial calculations use Excel formulas rather than hardcoded values, with assumptions (growth rates, margins, tax rate) placed in separate cells and referenced in formulas throughout the model.\n3. The three statements are properly integrated with formulas linking them together (net income flows to equity and cash flow, cash from cash flow statement flows to balance sheet, and the balance sheet balances in all years with Assets = Liabilities + Equity).\n4. The model applies standard financial modeling conventions including appropriate color coding for inputs/formulas, currency formatting with units specified in headers, zeros displayed as dashes, and negative numbers shown in parentheses.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent correctly identifies that the xlsx skill is needed for creating a complex spreadsheet with formulas and financial modeling formatting.\n2. The agent loads the SKILL.md file from the document-skills/xlsx skill to access instructions on Excel file creation, formula construction, color coding standards, and number formatting rules.\n3. The agent uses or references the recalc.py script to recalculate formulas after creating the Excel file and verify there are zero formula errors in the final output.\n4. The agent appropriately uses openpyxl to create the Excel file with formulas (not hardcoded values), applies the color coding standards from the skill (blue for inputs, black for formulas, green for cross-sheet links), implements proper number formatting (currency with dashes for zeros, parentheses for negatives), and runs formula recalculation to ensure all values are computed correctly without errors.",
