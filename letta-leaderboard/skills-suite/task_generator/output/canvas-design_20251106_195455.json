  "task": "I need you to create a sophisticated visual piece that explores the concept of \"temporal loops\" - the idea of time folding back on itself in cyclical patterns. This should be an abstract, museum-quality artwork that doesn't literally depict clocks or hourglasses, but instead uses geometric forms, spatial relationships, and thoughtful composition to evoke the feeling of recursive time. The final piece should be a single-page output that looks like it was painstakingly crafted by a master designer, with every element precisely placed and a cohesive visual language throughout. I want this to feel like it belongs in a modern art gallery, not like a typical poster or infographic.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A single-page visual artifact (.pdf or .png) is created that abstractly explores the concept of temporal loops through geometric forms, spatial relationships, and composition rather than literal time imagery.\n2. The artwork demonstrates sophisticated design choices including a cohesive color palette, intentional use of negative space, and precise element placement that creates visual harmony.\n3. The piece appears meticulously crafted with museum-quality execution - all elements are properly contained within canvas boundaries with appropriate margins, nothing overlaps inappropriately, and the overall composition shows expert-level attention to detail.\n4. Text is minimal and integrated as a visual element rather than explanatory content, with any typography serving as an aesthetic accent that enhances rather than dominates the composition.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The canvas-design skill is correctly identified and selected as the appropriate skill for creating a sophisticated visual artwork.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the canvas-design skill is loaded and its methodology is followed, including creating a design philosophy first before expressing it visually.\n3. At least one font file from the ./canvas-fonts directory is loaded and appropriately used in the final composition.\n4. The skill's principles are properly applied: a design philosophy (aesthetic movement) is created as a .md file, the subtle conceptual reference (temporal loops) is deduced and woven into the work without being literal, and the final output demonstrates the emphasized craftsmanship with a second refinement pass to achieve pristine, museum-quality results.",
