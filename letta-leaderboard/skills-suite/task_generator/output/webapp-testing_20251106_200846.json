  "task": "I have a local web application running on port 4200 that displays a dynamic image gallery. The gallery loads images asynchronously via JavaScript after the initial page load. Each image has a 'Like' button beneath it, and there's a counter at the top of the page showing the total number of likes.\n\nI need you to:\n1. Navigate to http://localhost:4200 and wait for all images to finish loading\n2. Capture a screenshot of the initial gallery state showing all loaded images\n3. Count how many images are displayed in the gallery and report this number\n4. Find and click the 'Like' button on the third image in the gallery\n5. Wait for the like counter to update (it should increment by 1)\n6. Capture a screenshot showing the updated like counter\n7. Click the 'Like' button on the first image as well\n8. Take a final screenshot showing the counter after both likes\n9. Extract the final like count from the counter element and verify it increased by 2 from the initial state\n10. Monitor the browser console for any JavaScript errors during the entire interaction\n\nThe server is already running and accepting connections. Provide all three screenshots, the initial and final like counts, the number of images found in the gallery, and a report of any console errors or warnings that occurred during the automation.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. Three screenshots were captured: initial gallery state, state after first like, and state after second like, all demonstrating the progression of interactions\n2. The automation successfully clicked the 'Like' buttons on the third and first images in the correct sequence, with verification that the like counter updated appropriately\n3. The final like count was extracted and verified to have increased by exactly 2 from the initial state, with both initial and final counts reported\n4. A complete report was provided including the number of images found in the gallery and any console errors or warnings that occurred during the automation process",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The webapp-testing skill was selected to complete the task involving local web application testing and browser automation\n2. The SKILL.md file for the webapp-testing skill was loaded to access the decision tree, best practices, and patterns for dynamic web application testing\n3. Additional files were appropriately referenced: console_logging.py example for monitoring console output and element_discovery.py example for finding and interacting with page elements\n4. The skill was used appropriately by following the reconnaissance-then-action pattern: navigating to the page, waiting for networkidle state before inspection, taking screenshots at appropriate intervals, using proper selectors to find elements, and capturing console logs throughout the interaction",
