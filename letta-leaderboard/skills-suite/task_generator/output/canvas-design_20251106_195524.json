  "task": "Create a single-page abstract visual composition that explores the philosophical concept of \"negative space as presence\" - the idea that what is absent can be as meaningful as what exists. This should be a museum-quality piece that uses vast empty areas not as voids but as active compositional elements that create tension, balance, and meaning. The work should employ a extremely limited palette (no more than 3 colors including black/white), geometric precision, and minimal textual elements that enhance rather than explain. The composition should feel like it was crafted with painstaking attention by a master designer, where every element - including the empty spaces - has been deliberated over for hours. This should not be decorative or illustrative, but rather a sophisticated meditation on absence and presence that could hang in a contemporary art gallery. Output both the design philosophy document and the final visual piece.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A design philosophy document (.md file) is created that articulates an aesthetic movement focused on visual expression through form, space, color, and composition, with 4-6 substantial paragraphs that emphasize craftsmanship and minimal text usage.\n2. A single-page visual composition (.pdf or .png) is created that demonstrates sophisticated use of negative space as an active compositional element, not merely as background.\n3. The final visual piece uses a limited color palette (maximum 3 colors including black/white), geometric precision, and minimal text that functions as a visual accent rather than explanation.\n4. The composition exhibits museum-quality craftsmanship with meticulous attention to spacing, alignment, and visual balance, appearing as though it was painstakingly created by an expert designer with no overlapping elements or formatting issues.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The canvas-design skill is correctly identified and selected as the appropriate skill for creating abstract visual art with design philosophy.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the canvas-design skill is loaded and its two-step process (Design Philosophy Creation followed by Canvas Creation) is followed.\n3. Font files from the canvas-fonts directory are accessed and used appropriately to create sophisticated typography that serves the visual composition.\n4. The skill's principles are applied appropriately, including: creating a visual philosophy first, expressing ideas through spatial relationships rather than text, emphasizing expert craftsmanship repeatedly, ensuring all elements are contained within canvas boundaries, and taking a second refinement pass to achieve pristine quality.",
