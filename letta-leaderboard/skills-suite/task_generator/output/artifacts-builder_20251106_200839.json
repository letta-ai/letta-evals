  "task": "Build an interactive task tracking application with a kanban-style board containing three columns: 'To Do', 'In Progress', and 'Done'. Users should be able to add new tasks via a form that includes fields for task title, description, priority (Low/Medium/High), and assigned user. Each task card should display this information along with a timestamp of when it was created. Users must be able to drag and drop tasks between columns to update their status. Include action buttons on each card to edit the task details (opening a dialog with pre-filled form fields) and delete the task. Add a statistics panel at the top showing the total number of tasks in each column and a breakdown by priority level across all columns. Implement a toggle switch to enable/disable dark mode that persists across page refreshes. The interface should use a left-aligned layout with distinct color coding for priority levels (not purple gradients). Make sure the application is fully responsive and works on mobile devices. The final deliverable should be a single self-contained HTML file.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The application implements a three-column kanban board (To Do, In Progress, Done) with drag-and-drop functionality that allows tasks to be moved between columns.\n2. A task creation form is present with fields for title, description, priority selection, and assigned user, and tasks display all this information plus a creation timestamp on their cards.\n3. Each task card has edit and delete functionality, where editing opens a dialog with pre-filled form fields that can be updated.\n4. A statistics panel displays task counts per column and priority breakdown, and a dark mode toggle is implemented with persistence across page refreshes, using appropriate non-purple color schemes and left-aligned layout.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The artifacts-builder skill is selected to complete the task.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the artifacts-builder skill is loaded and referenced for guidance on creating React-based artifacts with state management.\n3. The init-artifact.sh and bundle-artifact.sh scripts from the artifacts-builder/scripts directory are both loaded and executed to initialize the project and create the single HTML file output.\n4. The skill's workflow is followed appropriately: initializing with the init script, developing the React application with proper state management for drag-and-drop and dark mode persistence, bundling with the bundle script, and avoiding the discouraged design patterns (centered layouts, purple gradients, Inter font) as specified in the design guidelines.",
