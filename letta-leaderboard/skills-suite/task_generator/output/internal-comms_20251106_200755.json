  "task": "We had a production incident last night where our payment processing system went down for 3 hours (11pm to 2am PST). The root cause was a memory leak in the new version we deployed at 10:30pm. Our on-call engineer Sarah rolled back to the previous version at 1:45am, and services were fully restored by 2am. About 150 transactions were affected, and customers were shown error messages during checkout. The finance team estimates $12,000 in lost revenue. We're implementing additional memory profiling in staging and adding heap dump analysis to our deployment checklist. A post-mortem meeting is scheduled for Friday at 2pm. Write a report that documents what happened, how we responded, the impact, and our action items to prevent this from happening again.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The response documents the incident timeline including when the payment system went down (11pm PST), when the issue was detected, when the rollback occurred (1:45am), and when services were restored (2am).\n2. The response clearly identifies the root cause (memory leak in new deployment) and the immediate resolution (rollback to previous version by Sarah).\n3. The response quantifies the business impact including affected transactions (150), customer experience impact (error messages), and financial impact ($12,000 lost revenue).\n4. The response outlines specific preventive measures and action items including memory profiling improvements, heap dump analysis in deployment checklist, and the scheduled post-mortem meeting.",
