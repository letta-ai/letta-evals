  "task": "I need to create a reusable package for our QA team's API testing workflow. We work with REST APIs across multiple microservices and constantly perform the same testing patterns: (1) Send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests with authentication headers, (2) Validate response status codes and JSON schemas against our expected formats, (3) Test rate limiting behavior by sending bursts of requests, and (4) Generate test reports showing pass/fail rates and response times. I have a Python script I've been using that handles the authentication and request sending reliably, and I also have detailed documentation about our API endpoint conventions (base URLs, authentication token format, standard error codes, and retry logic). Additionally, I have a JSON template file that shows the structure we use for test reports. I want to package all of this into something that any QA engineer can use consistently - the authentication script should be readily available, the conventions should be documented, the report template should be included, and there should be clear step-by-step guidance on executing the complete testing workflow. Once it's created, I need it properly validated and packaged so I can distribute it to the entire QA team.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A new skill directory is initialized with proper structure including SKILL.md with valid YAML frontmatter (name and description fields), and appropriate subdirectories (scripts/, references/, assets/).\n2. The skill includes a Python script in the scripts/ directory for API authentication and request handling, a references/ file documenting API endpoint conventions (base URLs, authentication, error codes, retry logic), and an assets/ file containing the JSON report template.\n3. The SKILL.md file clearly describes: (a) the purpose of the API testing skill, (b) when it should be used, and (c) how to use each component (the authentication script, the conventions documentation, and the report template) in the testing workflow, written in imperative/infinitive form.\n4. The skill is validated and packaged into a distributable zip file using the packaging script, with all validation checks passing and the zip file created successfully.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The skill-creator skill is selected as the appropriate skill for this task.\n2. The skill-creator/SKILL.md file is loaded into the context window to access the skill creation process and guidelines.\n3. The scripts/init_skill.py and scripts/package_skill.py files from the skill-creator skill are loaded and executed appropriately during the workflow.\n4. The skill creation follows the documented process in order: understanding the concrete examples (Step 1), planning reusable contents (Step 2), initializing with init_skill.py (Step 3), editing SKILL.md and creating bundled resources in appropriate directories (Step 4), and packaging with package_skill.py (Step 5), with proper use of scripts/, references/, and assets/ directories as defined in the skill-creator guidelines.",
