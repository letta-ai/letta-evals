  "task": "Our company just announced that we're discontinuing our legacy VPN client and transitioning everyone to a new zero-trust security platform called SecureAccess. The IT team will begin migrating users in phases starting February 15th. Employees in Sales and Marketing will be migrated first (Feb 15-22), followed by Engineering and Product (Feb 23-Mar 1), and finally Finance and Operations (Mar 2-8). During migration, employees will receive an email with installation instructions and a unique activation code. They'll need to uninstall the old VPN client before installing SecureAccess. The new platform offers better performance, works on mobile devices, and doesn't require manual connection - it automatically secures traffic when accessing company resources. IT will host live training sessions every Tuesday and Thursday at 10am and 3pm throughout February. A dedicated Slack channel #secureaccess-help has been created for questions. Write a company-wide announcement that explains what's changing, why we're making this change, what employees need to know about the timeline and process, and where they can get help. Make sure this reaches all employees and gets them prepared for the transition.",
