  "task": "I need a sophisticated abstract visual piece that explores the concept of 'acoustic resonance' - the idea that sound creates visible patterns and frequencies ripple through space. This should be a single-page composition that doesn't literally show sound waves or musical notes, but instead uses repeated geometric forms, rhythmic spacing, and harmonic color relationships to evoke the physical sensation of vibration and resonance. The final work should feel like it was created by a master craftsperson who spent countless hours perfecting the balance between repetition and variation, between order and rhythm. I want something that could be exhibited in a contemporary art museum as a meditation on invisible forces made visible through design. The piece should use minimal text (if any) and let the visual language speak entirely through form, pattern, and spatial relationships.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The output includes both a design philosophy document (.md file) and a final visual composition (.pdf or .png file) that can be downloaded.\n2. The visual piece is abstract and sophisticated, exploring the concept of acoustic resonance through geometric forms, rhythmic patterns, and spatial relationships rather than literal depictions of sound waves or musical instruments.\n3. The composition demonstrates expert-level craftsmanship with meticulous attention to detail, including precise alignment, balanced spacing, cohesive color palette (limited colors), and minimal or no text that serves as a visual element rather than explanation.\n4. The final work appears as a museum-quality piece with repeated geometric elements and patterns that evoke rhythm, vibration, and harmonic relationships, with all elements contained within canvas boundaries and proper margins maintained.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The canvas-design skill is selected and identified as the appropriate skill for creating this abstract visual art piece.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the canvas-design skill is loaded and referenced to guide the creation process, including the two-step approach of design philosophy creation followed by visual expression.\n3. Additional files from the canvas-fonts directory are accessed and appropriate fonts are selected and used to enhance the visual composition with design-forward typography.\n4. The skill is used appropriately by first creating a 4-6 paragraph design philosophy that emphasizes visual expression, minimal text, spatial communication, and expert craftsmanship, followed by expressing that philosophy on a canvas with sophisticated abstract composition that treats the concept as a subtle reference woven into the visual DNA rather than a literal representation.",
