  "task": "I need a single-page abstract composition that explores the philosophical concept of 'crystalline thought' - the idea that ideas form structured, geometric patterns as they solidify in the mind, like minerals growing in precise lattices. This should not be a literal illustration of crystals or brain imagery, but rather a sophisticated visual meditation on how abstract concepts take shape through repetition, symmetry, and systematic growth. The piece should employ geometric precision with forms that suggest both organic growth and mathematical order - think about how hexagonal patterns, angular facets, or radial symmetries might evoke the sensation of thought becoming structure. I want a restrained palette (no more than 3-4 colors) that feels mineral and intentional, with any textual elements functioning as subtle anchors rather than explanations. The final work should demonstrate absolute mastery of composition and craftsmanship - the kind of piece that looks like it required weeks of refinement by a world-class designer and could be exhibited in a contemporary art museum's collection on the intersection of cognition and form. This should feel like a scientific artifact from an imaginary discipline that studies how immaterial concepts crystallize into visible patterns.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The output includes both a design philosophy document (.md file) and a final visual composition (.pdf or .png file) that can be downloaded.\n2. The visual composition is a single-page abstract work that evokes the concept of 'crystalline thought' through geometric forms, repetition, symmetry, or systematic patterns without literally depicting crystals or brains.\n3. The piece uses a restrained color palette (3-4 colors maximum) and minimal text that functions as visual punctuation rather than explanation.\n4. The final composition demonstrates sophisticated craftsmanship with precise geometric elements, cohesive visual language, proper spacing/margins, and no overlapping elements - appearing as museum-quality work that could be exhibited in a contemporary art context.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The canvas-design skill is selected as the appropriate skill for creating this abstract visual artwork based on a philosophical concept.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the canvas-design skill is loaded and its instructions are followed, including the two-step process of creating a design philosophy first, then expressing it visually.\n3. Font files from the canvas-fonts directory are accessed and used appropriately to achieve sophisticated typography that integrates with the visual composition.\n4. The skill is used appropriately by creating an original abstract visual philosophy (not copying existing artists' work), emphasizing expert craftsmanship throughout, using minimal text as visual elements, and producing a sophisticated composition that treats the concept as a subtle reference woven into the visual language rather than literal illustration.",
