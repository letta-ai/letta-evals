  "task": "I need help organizing my team's specialized workflows into a reusable package. We frequently work with marketing campaign analysis, and I keep finding myself re-explaining the same process: (1) Extract campaign data from our CSV exports, (2) Calculate key metrics like CTR, conversion rate, and ROAS using specific formulas our company uses, (3) Generate a summary report following our standard template format, and (4) Create visualizations comparing performance across channels. I've already written a Python script that does the metric calculations correctly, and I have a Markdown template that shows our preferred report structure. I want to bundle these together with clear instructions so that anyone (or any AI assistant) can execute this workflow consistently. The package should include the calculation script, the report template, and step-by-step guidance on when and how to use each component. Once it's ready, I need it validated and packaged in a format I can easily share with my team.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The agent creates a properly structured directory with SKILL.md containing YAML frontmatter (name and description fields) and markdown instructions that explain the marketing campaign analysis workflow.\n2. The agent organizes resources appropriately, placing the Python calculation script in a scripts/ directory and the Markdown report template in either references/ or assets/ directory based on its intended use.\n3. The SKILL.md file clearly documents when to use the skill and provides instructions on how to use both the calculation script and report template in the workflow.\n4. The agent validates and packages the skill into a distributable zip file using the appropriate packaging script.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent identifies and selects the skill-creator skill as the appropriate skill for this task involving creating a reusable workflow package.\n2. The agent loads the skill-creator/SKILL.md file to access the skill creation process and guidelines.\n3. The agent loads and uses the init_skill.py script to create the initial skill structure and the package_skill.py script to validate and package the final skill.\n4. The agent follows the skill creation process outlined in SKILL.md, including understanding the workflow, planning reusable contents, initializing the skill structure, editing SKILL.md with appropriate metadata and instructions, and packaging the final skill with validation.",
