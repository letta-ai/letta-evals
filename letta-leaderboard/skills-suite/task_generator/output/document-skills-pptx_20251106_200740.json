  "task": "I need to create a 6-slide presentation for a marine conservation nonprofit called Ocean Guardians. The presentation should cover: (1) Title slide with organization name and tagline 'Protecting Our Oceans for Future Generations', (2) The Problem - overview of ocean pollution statistics, (3) Our Mission - what Ocean Guardians does, (4) Current Projects - list 3 active conservation projects, (5) Impact Metrics - a simple bar chart showing tons of plastic removed over 3 years (2022: 45 tons, 2023: 78 tons, 2024: 112 tons), and (6) Get Involved - call to action with ways to support. The design should reflect the marine conservation theme with appropriate colors that evoke ocean, nature, and environmental protection. Make sure the chart slide uses a proper layout that gives the chart enough space to be readable. After creating the presentation, generate a thumbnail grid so I can see all slides at once.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A PowerPoint presentation file (.pptx) is created with exactly 6 slides covering all requested content: title slide, problem overview, mission, projects list, impact metrics with chart, and call to action.\n2. The presentation uses a color palette and design choices that are clearly inspired by marine conservation themes (ocean blues, greens, natural tones) with an explicit explanation of the design rationale.\n3. Slide 5 contains a bar chart displaying the plastic removal data (2022: 45 tons, 2023: 78 tons, 2024: 112 tons) and uses either a full-slide layout or two-column layout (not vertically stacked).\n4. A thumbnail grid image is generated showing all 6 slides in a single visual overview for quick review.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The pptx skill (document-skills/pptx) is explicitly selected or mentioned as the appropriate skill for this presentation creation task.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the pptx skill is loaded and read to understand the workflows for creating presentations.\n3. The html2pptx.md file is loaded and read completely (as required by the workflow) before creating the presentation, and the html2pptx.js library is used along with Sharp for any graphics processing.\n4. The agent follows the html2pptx workflow appropriately: states design choices before coding, creates HTML files for slides with proper dimensions and web-safe fonts, uses placeholder class for chart areas, generates the presentation using the html2pptx.js script with PptxGenJS API to add the chart, and uses thumbnail.py to create the visual grid for validation.",
