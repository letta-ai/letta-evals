  "task": "Create an interactive recipe management dashboard that allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter recipes. The dashboard should have a modern card-based layout with a sidebar for filtering by category (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert). Each recipe card should display the recipe name, cooking time, difficulty level, and a thumbnail placeholder. Include a modal dialog that opens when users click 'Add Recipe' or edit an existing recipe, with form fields for recipe name, category (dropdown), cooking time (number input), difficulty (select: Easy/Medium/Hard), and ingredients (textarea). The recipe list should support real-time filtering by category and a search bar to filter by recipe name. Use proper state management and ensure the interface is responsive. Avoid centered layouts, purple gradients, and the Inter font. Bundle everything into a single HTML file that can be shared as an artifact.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The artifact includes a functional recipe management interface with the ability to add, edit, and delete recipes with all specified fields (name, category, cooking time, difficulty, ingredients).\n2. The interface implements both category-based filtering via sidebar and text-based search functionality that works in real-time.\n3. A modal dialog is present that opens for both adding new recipes and editing existing recipes, with appropriate form controls (dropdown for category, number input for time, select for difficulty, textarea for ingredients).\n4. The final deliverable is a single bundled HTML file containing all code, styling, and dependencies inline.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The artifacts-builder skill is selected as the appropriate skill for this task.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the artifacts-builder skill is loaded and referenced.\n3. The initialization script (init-artifact.sh) and bundling script (bundle-artifact.sh) from the scripts directory are both executed appropriately.\n4. The skill's workflow is followed correctly: project initialization, development using React with TypeScript and shadcn/ui components (such as Card, Dialog, Button, Input, Select), bundling to a single HTML file, and the design guidelines about avoiding AI slop are respected.",
