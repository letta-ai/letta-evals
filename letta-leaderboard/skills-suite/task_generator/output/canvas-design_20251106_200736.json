  "task": "I need a single-page visual artwork that explores the concept of 'cartographic memory' - the idea that our memories are mapped territories with borders, landmarks, and unexplored regions. This should be an abstract, sophisticated composition that evokes the feeling of navigation through internal landscapes without literally depicting maps or brains. I want something that feels like it was created by a world-class designer who spent weeks perfecting every detail - the kind of piece that could be featured in a contemporary art museum's collection on the intersection of cognition and visual culture. The work should use geometric precision, a restrained color palette, and minimal textual elements that function as part of the visual architecture rather than explanatory labels. This isn't about illustration or decoration; it's about creating a meditation on how we chart our own histories through space and form.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The output includes a single-page visual artwork delivered as a downloadable .pdf or .png file that explores the concept of 'cartographic memory' through abstract visual means rather than literal representation.\n2. The composition demonstrates geometric precision, uses a restrained color palette (no more than 4-5 colors), and incorporates minimal textual elements that function as visual architecture rather than explanatory text.\n3. The work exhibits museum-quality craftsmanship with meticulous attention to spacing, alignment, and compositional balance - appearing as though it was created by an expert designer over an extended period.\n4. A design philosophy document (.md file) is provided alongside the visual artwork that articulates the aesthetic movement and principles used to create the piece.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The canvas-design skill is selected as the appropriate skill for completing this task.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the canvas-design skill is loaded and its instructions are followed, including the two-step process of creating a design philosophy first, then expressing it visually.\n3. Font files from the canvas-fonts directory are accessed and used appropriately in the final composition to ensure typography is design-forward and sophisticated.\n4. The skill's principles are properly applied, including: creating an original design philosophy (4-6 paragraphs), deducing the subtle conceptual reference (cartographic memory), expressing the philosophy through primarily visual means with minimal text, ensuring expert-level craftsmanship, and taking a second refinement pass to achieve museum-quality results.",
