  "task": "I need to prepare a batch processing report for a document management system. Here's what I need:\n\n1. Create three separate single-page documents with the following content:\n   - Document A: A header 'Processing Log - Batch 001' and a table with columns 'Document ID', 'Status', 'Timestamp' containing 3 rows of sample data (use IDs: DOC-2024-001, DOC-2024-002, DOC-2024-003 with statuses 'Complete', 'Failed', 'Complete' and timestamps from January 10, 2024)\n   - Document B: A header 'Processing Log - Batch 002' and similar table with 3 different document IDs (DOC-2024-004, DOC-2024-005, DOC-2024-006 with statuses 'Complete', 'Complete', 'Pending' and timestamps from January 11, 2024)\n   - Document C: A summary page with header 'Batch Processing Summary' and text stating 'Total documents processed: 6' and 'Success rate: 83.3%'\n\n2. Combine all three documents into a single consolidated report named 'batch_report.pdf' with Document C as the first page, followed by Document A and Document B.\n\n3. Extract the metadata from the consolidated report and verify it contains 3 pages.\n\n4. Extract all tables from the consolidated document and display them in a structured format showing all document IDs, their statuses, and timestamps.\n\n5. Create a certificate of completion document that says 'BATCH PROCESSING COMPLETE' diagonally across the page, then overlay this as a semi-transparent mark on page 1 only (the summary page) of the consolidated report. Save this as 'batch_report_certified.pdf'.\n\n6. Extract and display all text content from page 2 of the certified report to verify the processing log data is intact.\n\n7. Split the certified report into individual pages saved as 'page_1.pdf', 'page_2.pdf', and 'page_3.pdf'.\n\nProvide confirmation of each completed step, showing the extracted table data from step 4 and the text content from step 6.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. Three initial single-page documents (A, B, C) are created with the specified headers, tables, and content, followed by successful consolidation into a 3-page 'batch_report.pdf' with pages in the correct order (C, A, B).\n2. Metadata is extracted showing 3 pages, and all tables are extracted and displayed in structured format showing all 6 document IDs (DOC-2024-001 through DOC-2024-006) with their corresponding statuses and timestamps.\n3. A certificate overlay document is created and applied only to page 1 of the consolidated report, producing 'batch_report_certified.pdf', and text content from page 2 of this certified report is extracted and displayed.\n4. The certified report is successfully split into three separate single-page files named 'page_1.pdf', 'page_2.pdf', and 'page_3.pdf', with confirmation provided for each step along with the requested extracted data.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The `document-skills/pdf` skill is selected as the primary skill to complete the task.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the `document-skills/pdf` skill is loaded into the context to access PDF manipulation instructions and code examples.\n3. No additional files from the pdf skill directory (forms.md, reference.md, scripts/) need to be loaded as the task involves standard PDF operations covered in SKILL.md (creation, merging, splitting, text/table extraction, and watermarking).\n4. The skill is used appropriately with correct implementation of reportlab for PDF creation, pypdf for merging/splitting/watermarking operations, pdfplumber for text and table extraction, and proper handling of multi-page document workflows.",
