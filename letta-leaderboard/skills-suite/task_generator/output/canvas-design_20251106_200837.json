  "task": "I need you to create a single-page abstract visual artwork that explores the philosophical concept of 'temporal stratification' - the idea that multiple layers of time coexist simultaneously in the same space, like geological strata or palimpsests where past, present, and future overlap and become visible through one another. This should NOT be a literal illustration of layers or timelines. Instead, I want a sophisticated composition that uses translucency, overlapping geometric forms, varied densities, and a carefully calibrated color palette to evoke the sensation of looking through time itself - where what came before shows through what exists now, and what might come creates ghostly anticipations in the present moment. The work must demonstrate absolute mastery of craft - the kind of piece that looks like it required weeks of meticulous refinement by someone at the absolute peak of their abilities. This should feel like it belongs in a major contemporary art institution's permanent collection on phenomenology and temporal experience, not like commercial design work. Any textual elements should be extremely minimal and function as integral parts of the visual architecture rather than explanatory content. I want both the conceptual design document and the final visual composition as outputs.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The output includes both a design philosophy document (.md file) and a final visual artwork (.png or .pdf file) that are provided as downloadable files.\n2. The visual artwork is a single-page abstract composition that conceptually addresses 'temporal stratification' through visual elements like overlapping forms, translucency effects, layering, or spatial density rather than literal depictions of time or clocks.\n3. The composition demonstrates sophisticated aesthetic choices including a limited color palette (no more than 4-5 colors), precise geometric forms, careful spatial relationships, and minimal text that functions as a visual element rather than explanation.\n4. The final artwork exhibits museum-quality craftsmanship with meticulous attention to detail, perfect alignment, proper margins, no overlapping elements, and a cohesive visual language that appears painstakingly refined.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent correctly identifies and selects the canvas-design skill as the appropriate skill for creating abstract visual artwork based on a philosophical concept.\n2. The agent loads the SKILL.md file from the canvas-design skill directory to access the instructions for design philosophy creation and canvas creation.\n3. The agent accesses and uses appropriate font files from the canvas-fonts directory within the canvas-design skill folder to implement sophisticated typography in the visual composition.\n4. The agent follows the two-step process defined in the skill (creating a design philosophy first, then expressing it visually), emphasizes craftsmanship and museum-quality execution throughout, maintains minimal text usage, and creates abstract visual work rather than literal illustration, all in accordance with the skill's core principles.",
