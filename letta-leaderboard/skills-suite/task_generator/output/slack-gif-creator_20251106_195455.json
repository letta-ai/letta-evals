  "task": "I need an animated reaction emoji for our team's Slack workspace that shows excitement building up and then exploding into celebration. The animation should start with a small, anticipatory emotion, then quickly escalate through increasing intensity, and finally burst into a celebratory explosion with confetti or sparkles. The entire animation should loop smoothly and be under 64KB so I can upload it as a custom emoji. Make it vibrant and energetic - something we'd use when announcing wins or achievements. The animation should be short enough to loop naturally (1-2 seconds) and work well at small sizes since it'll appear inline with text messages.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. An animated GIF file is created that visually depicts a progression from anticipation to celebration (e.g., emoji growing, changing expression, or building energy before exploding)\n2. The GIF includes a celebratory explosion effect with visual elements like confetti, sparkles, or particle effects in the final phase\n3. The GIF file size is 64KB or less, making it suitable for upload as a Slack custom emoji\n4. The animation dimensions are appropriate for emoji use (around 128x128 pixels) and the duration is between 1-2 seconds with smooth looping",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The slack-gif-creator skill is selected as the skill to use for this task\n2. The SKILL.md file from the slack-gif-creator skill is loaded into the context\n3. At least three additional files from the skill are loaded and utilized, such as gif_builder.py for assembly, validators.py for size checking, and template files for animation primitives (e.g., pulse.py, explode.py, visual_effects.py)\n4. The skill's validators are used to check the 64KB emoji size constraint, optimization strategies for emoji GIFs are applied (limited frames, reduced colors, optimize_for_emoji flag), and animation primitives are composed appropriately to create the build-up and explosion effect",
