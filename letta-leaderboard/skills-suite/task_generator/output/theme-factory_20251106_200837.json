  "task": "I'm creating an annual report for a nonprofit environmental organization focused on ocean conservation and marine wildlife protection. The report will be shared with major donors, board members, and foundation grant officers who supported our work this year. We want to celebrate our achievements while maintaining credibility and professionalism. The visual design should feel connected to our mission\u2014evoking the ocean, marine life, and water conservation\u2014while still being sophisticated enough for a formal annual report. I'd like the color palette to reflect our oceanic focus, and the typography should balance professionalism with a sense of purpose and environmental stewardship. Can you show me different visual design options that would work for this context, and then help me choose and apply the one that best captures the professional yet mission-aligned aesthetic we're looking for?",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The agent displays or presents multiple visual design theme options (at least 2-3 distinct themes) for the user to review and compare.\n2. The agent provides clear guidance or discussion about which theme(s) would be most appropriate for an ocean conservation nonprofit annual report, considering the professional donor/board audience and oceanic/environmental mission.\n3. The agent requests or waits for explicit user confirmation or selection of a preferred theme before proceeding with application.\n4. The agent provides specific details about how the selected theme would be applied, including references to the theme's specific colors (with hex codes) and font pairings that align with the ocean conservation and professional annual report context.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent identifies and selects the theme-factory skill as relevant to this task involving visual design themes for a document/report.\n2. The agent loads the theme-factory skill by accessing its SKILL.md file to understand the available themes and application process.\n3. The agent loads the theme-showcase.pdf file to display available themes, and subsequently loads at least one theme definition file from the themes/ directory (such as ocean-depths.md or other relevant theme files) to provide specific color and font details.\n4. The agent follows the skill's prescribed workflow: first showing the theme showcase, then discussing theme appropriateness for the ocean conservation context, waiting for user selection, and finally explaining how to apply the chosen theme with specific color hex codes and font specifications from the loaded theme file(s).",
