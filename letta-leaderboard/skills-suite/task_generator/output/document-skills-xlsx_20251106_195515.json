  "task": "I need to create a 3-statement financial model for a startup. Here are the assumptions:\n\n**Revenue Assumptions:**\n- Year 1 (2024) Revenue: $2,500,000\n- Year 2-5 Growth Rate: 25% annually\n\n**Operating Expenses (as % of Revenue):**\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 40%\n- Sales & Marketing: 20%\n- R&D: 15%\n- G&A: 10%\n\n**Balance Sheet Assumptions:**\n- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO): 45 days\n- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO): 30 days\n- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO): 60 days\n- Initial Cash: $1,000,000\n- PPE as % of Revenue: 5% (straight-line depreciation over 5 years)\n- Debt: $500,000 with 8% annual interest rate\n\n**Cash Flow:**\n- Tax Rate: 25%\n- Capex as % of Revenue Growth: 10%\n\nCreate a complete Excel financial model with three worksheets (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) covering years 2024-2028. All assumptions should be in blue text in a dedicated assumptions section at the top. All calculations must use formulas referencing the assumption cells - no hardcoded values in formulas. Format all currency values with thousand separators and show zeros as dashes. Make sure the model has zero formula errors and that the balance sheet balances (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) for all years.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The Excel file contains three separate worksheets named Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement with financial projections for years 2024-2028.\n2. An assumptions section is present with all specified inputs (revenue, growth rates, expense percentages, working capital metrics, debt terms, tax rate, etc.) formatted in blue text, and all formulas reference these assumption cells rather than containing hardcoded values.\n3. All financial calculations are correct and interconnected (Net Income flows to equity, depreciation impacts all three statements, working capital changes affect cash flow, interest expense is calculated from debt balance, and the balance sheet balances with Assets = Liabilities + Equity for all years).\n4. All currency values use proper formatting with thousand separators and zeros displayed as dashes, and the file contains zero formula errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #N/A, #NAME?).",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent correctly identifies and selects the document-skills/xlsx skill as the appropriate skill for creating a financial model spreadsheet.\n2. The agent loads the SKILL.md file from the document-skills/xlsx skill to access spreadsheet creation instructions and best practices.\n3. The agent loads and uses the recalc.py script to recalculate all formulas after creating the Excel file and verifies there are no formula errors.\n4. The agent follows the skill's financial modeling standards including color coding conventions (blue for inputs, black for formulas), uses Excel formulas instead of hardcoding calculated values, implements proper number formatting with zeros as dashes, places all assumptions in separate cells for reference, and runs the recalc.py script to ensure all formula values are calculated and error-free.",
