  "task": "I'm building a specialized capability for our backend engineering team that works with microservices. We constantly need to: (1) Parse and validate JSON API responses against expected schemas, (2) Generate mock API response data for testing, (3) Transform nested JSON structures into flat CSV format for database imports, and (4) Pretty-print JSON with syntax highlighting for documentation. I've already developed a reliable Python script that handles the schema validation using jsonschema library, and I have comprehensive documentation about our company's API design patterns (REST conventions, pagination formats, error response structures, rate limiting headers). I want to package this into a reusable solution that any engineer on the team can leverage consistently. The package should include my validation script, the API design pattern documentation, and complete workflow instructions covering when to use validation vs. transformation vs. mock generation. After creating this, I need it properly validated and packaged so I can distribute it across our engineering organization.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The agent must initialize a new skill using the init_skill.py script with an appropriate skill name related to JSON/API handling.\n2. The agent must create or describe creating a Python script for JSON schema validation in the scripts/ directory and API design pattern documentation in the references/ directory.\n3. The agent must update the SKILL.md file with proper YAML frontmatter (name and description), purpose statement, usage triggers, and instructions on how to use the bundled scripts and references.\n4. The agent must package the skill using package_skill.py to create a distributable zip file after validation passes.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent must select the skill-creator skill to complete this task.\n2. The agent must load the skill-creator/SKILL.md file to understand the skill creation process.\n3. The agent must load and use the init_skill.py and package_skill.py scripts from skill-creator/scripts/ directory.\n4. The agent must follow the systematic skill creation process from SKILL.md, including understanding requirements (Step 1), planning reusable contents (Step 2), initializing with the script (Step 3), editing the skill with proper structure and imperative writing style (Step 4), and packaging with validation (Step 5).",
