  "task": "I have a multi-page research report that needs to be reorganized and enhanced. Create a workflow that does the following:\n\n1. First, create a sample 5-page research report document with these pages:\n   - Page 1: Title page with 'Annual Market Analysis 2024' and author name 'Dr. Sarah Chen'\n   - Page 2: Executive Summary with a paragraph describing market trends\n   - Page 3: A data table showing quarterly revenue figures for 4 quarters\n   - Page 4: Methodology section with 2-3 paragraphs\n   - Page 5: References page with 3 sample citations\n\n2. Extract and display the metadata from this document (title, author, page count)\n\n3. Split the document so that pages 1-2 become one file ('report_front.pdf') and pages 3-5 become another file ('report_data.pdf')\n\n4. Create a new cover page document that includes:\n   - 'CONFIDENTIAL' watermark text\n   - Document title in large font\n   - A disclaimer: 'This document contains proprietary information'\n   - Current date\n\n5. Merge the new cover page with the original report to create a final document with 6 pages total\n\n6. Extract all text content from pages 2-4 of the final merged document and provide it as output\n\n7. Finally, apply password protection to the final document using the password 'Market2024!'\n\nProvide confirmation of each step completed along with the extracted text content from step 6.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A 5-page research report PDF is created with all specified content (title page, executive summary, data table, methodology, references)\n2. The document is correctly split into two separate files with pages 1-2 in one file and pages 3-5 in another, a new cover page is created with confidential marking and disclaimer, and all files are merged into a final 6-page document\n3. Text content is successfully extracted from pages 2-4 of the final merged document and displayed in the output\n4. The final merged document is encrypted with password protection using the specified password 'Market2024!'",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The document-skills/pdf skill is selected to complete the task\n2. The SKILL.md file from document-skills/pdf is loaded to access PDF manipulation instructions\n3. No additional files from the skill directory are required or loaded (the task uses only basic operations covered in SKILL.md)\n4. The skill is used appropriately with correct application of reportlab for PDF creation, pypdf for splitting/merging/encryption/metadata extraction, and pdfplumber or pypdf for text extraction following the patterns and examples provided in SKILL.md",
