  "task": "Create an animated GIF for use in Slack messages that shows a rocket ship launching into space. The animation should start with the rocket sitting on the ground at the bottom of the frame, then it should lift off with a smooth acceleration upward. As it moves, add a trail of fire/exhaust particles behind it. When the rocket reaches about 3/4 of the way up the frame, it should tilt slightly to the right as if changing trajectory, then zoom off the top-right corner of the screen. The whole animation should be about 3-4 seconds long. Make it suitable for sharing in Slack messages (not as a custom emoji), so optimize it for around 480x480 dimensions and keep it under 2MB. Use vibrant colors to make it eye-catching. Verify that the final file meets the size requirements.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The GIF shows a rocket emoji/object that starts at the bottom of the frame and moves upward in a launching motion.\n2. The animation includes visual effects such as particle trails, fire, or exhaust behind the rocket during movement.\n3. The rocket changes trajectory by tilting or curving toward the right side before exiting the frame through the top-right corner.\n4. The final GIF file is verified to be under 2MB and optimized for Slack message use (approximately 480x480 dimensions, 3-4 seconds duration).",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The slack-gif-creator skill is selected and identified as relevant to the task.\n2. The SKILL.md file from the slack-gif-creator skill is loaded into the context.\n3. Multiple additional files from the skill are loaded, including at minimum: core/gif_builder.py, core/validators.py, templates/move.py, and core/visual_effects.py (or other relevant template/core files for creating the animation effects).\n4. The skill's components are used appropriately: GIFBuilder is used to create and save the GIF, move animation primitives or easing functions are used for the rocket trajectory, visual effects (particle system or similar) are used for the exhaust trail, and validators are used to check that the final file meets Slack's message GIF requirements.",
