  "task": "I'm working on a product comparison page at /tmp/comparison.html that displays three products side by side. Each product card has a 'Show Details' button that, when clicked, expands to reveal additional information using JavaScript animations.\n\nThe HTML structure includes:\n- Three product cards with class='product-card'\n- Each card has a button with class='details-btn' containing the text 'Show Details'\n- Hidden detail sections with class='product-details' that appear when buttons are clicked\n- A comparison summary div with id='summary' at the bottom that updates to show how many products have their details visible\n\nI need you to:\n1. Open the HTML file in a browser and take a screenshot of the initial collapsed state\n2. Click the 'Show Details' button on the first product card (leftmost)\n3. Wait for the animation to complete and capture a screenshot showing the expanded details\n4. Click the 'Show Details' button on the third product card (rightmost)\n5. Capture a screenshot showing both the first and third products expanded\n6. Read the text content from the summary div to see how many products are currently expanded\n7. Locate and report the text content from all visible product detail sections\n8. Monitor and report any JavaScript errors or warnings in the console during the interactions\n\nProvide all three screenshots, the summary text, the detailed content that became visible, and confirmation that the JavaScript animations executed without errors.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. Three screenshots are provided showing: (a) initial state with all products collapsed, (b) first product expanded, and (c) first and third products expanded\n2. The text content from the summary div is extracted and reported, indicating the count of expanded products\n3. The detailed text content from the expanded product sections (first and third products) is extracted and reported\n4. Console logs are captured and any JavaScript errors or warnings during the button interactions are reported (or confirmation that no errors occurred)",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The webapp-testing skill is selected to handle the task of testing a local HTML file with interactive JavaScript functionality\n2. The webapp-testing skill's SKILL.md file is loaded to access instructions on testing static HTML files and capturing browser interactions\n3. The static_html_automation.py and console_logging.py example files are loaded as they demonstrate the relevant patterns for working with file:// URLs and capturing console output\n4. The skill is used appropriately by: (a) opening the static HTML file using file:// URL approach, (b) using Playwright to interact with buttons and wait for animations, (c) capturing multiple screenshots at different interaction states, (d) extracting text content from specific elements, and (e) monitoring console output for JavaScript errors",
