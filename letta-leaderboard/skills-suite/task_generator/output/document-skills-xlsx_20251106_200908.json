  "task": "I'm analyzing our company's employee compensation structure and need help creating a comprehensive analysis workbook. Here's our current employee data:\n\n**Engineering Team:**\n- Senior Engineers (8 employees): Base salary $145,000, Stock grants $35,000/year, Annual bonus target 15%\n- Mid-level Engineers (15 employees): Base salary $110,000, Stock grants $22,000/year, Annual bonus target 12%\n- Junior Engineers (12 employees): Base salary $85,000, Stock grants $12,000/year, Annual bonus target 10%\n\n**Product Team:**\n- Product Managers (5 employees): Base salary $135,000, Stock grants $30,000/year, Annual bonus target 18%\n- Product Designers (6 employees): Base salary $120,000, Stock grants $25,000/year, Annual bonus target 15%\n- Product Analysts (4 employees): Base salary $95,000, Stock grants $18,000/year, Annual bonus target 12%\n\n**Sales Team:**\n- Enterprise Sales (10 employees): Base salary $95,000, Stock grants $20,000/year, Commission target $80,000/year, Annual bonus target 10%\n- SMB Sales (14 employees): Base salary $75,000, Stock grants $15,000/year, Commission target $45,000/year, Annual bonus target 8%\n\n**Operations Team:**\n- Operations Managers (3 employees): Base salary $105,000, Stock grants $20,000/year, Annual bonus target 12%\n- Operations Specialists (9 employees): Base salary $70,000, Stock grants $10,000/year, Annual bonus target 10%\n\nCreate a multi-sheet workbook with the following analyses:\n\n1. **Compensation Data** sheet: Structure all employee role data in a table with columns for Team, Role, Employee Count, Base Salary, Stock Grants, Commission Target (where applicable), and Bonus Target %.\n\n2. **Total Compensation** sheet: Calculate for each role the total target compensation (Base + Stock + Commission if applicable + Bonus calculated from base salary). Then calculate total annual compensation cost by role (multiply by employee count) and aggregate totals by team and overall company. All calculations must use formulas referencing the Compensation Data sheet.\n\n3. **Compensation Analytics** sheet: Calculate the following metrics using formulas: (a) Average compensation per employee by team, (b) Percentage of total company compensation budget allocated to each team, (c) Mix analysis showing what percentage of each role's total compensation comes from base vs. variable components (stock + bonus + commission), (d) Cost per employee compared to company average with variance calculations.\n\n4. **Scenario Planning** sheet: Create assumption cells for potential changes: Cost of Living Adjustment % (set to 4%), Promotion Rate % (set to 15% of employees), and Average Promotion Increase % (set to 12%). Calculate the projected total compensation cost after applying these adjustments. Show the budget impact in both dollar terms and percentage increase from current state.\n\n5. **Benchmarking** sheet: Given market data showing the 50th percentile total compensation for comparable roles (Senior Engineer: $195K, Product Manager: $180K, Enterprise Sales: $210K, Operations Manager: $140K), calculate how our compensation compares to market. Show variance in dollars and percentage, and identify which roles are above or below market using formulas.\n\nApply professional formatting throughout: use currency format with thousand separators and zeros displayed as dashes, percentages to one decimal place, and proper color coding (blue text for assumption/input cells, black for formulas, green for cross-sheet references). Column widths should be adjusted for readability. All calculations must be formula-driven with cell references - absolutely no hardcoded computed values. The workbook must have zero formula errors after recalculation.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. All five sheets (Compensation Data, Total Compensation, Compensation Analytics, Scenario Planning, Benchmarking) are created with the correct structure and calculations as specified in the task\n2. All compensation calculations are performed using Excel formulas with proper cell references (no hardcoded calculated values), including total target compensation, team aggregations, averages, percentages, mix analysis, scenario adjustments, and market variance calculations\n3. The workbook uses proper financial formatting including currency with thousand separators, zeros as dashes, percentages to one decimal place, and appropriate color coding (blue for inputs, black for formulas, green for cross-sheet references)\n4. The file is successfully created, all formulas are recalculated using the recalc.py script, and the workbook has zero formula errors as verified by the recalculation output",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The document-skills/xlsx skill is selected and identified as the appropriate skill for this spreadsheet creation and analysis task\n2. The SKILL.md file from the document-skills/xlsx skill is loaded to access comprehensive instructions on Excel file creation, formula construction, formatting standards, and recalculation procedures\n3. The recalc.py script from the skill's additional files is loaded and executed to recalculate all formulas and verify zero formula errors in the completed workbook\n4. The skill guidelines are followed appropriately including using openpyxl for creation with formulas, applying financial formatting standards (color coding, number formats, zeros as dashes), ensuring all calculations use cell references rather than hardcoded values, and verifying the output has zero formula errors through the recalculation script",
