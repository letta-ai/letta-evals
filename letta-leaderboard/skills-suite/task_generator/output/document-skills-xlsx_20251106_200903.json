  "task": "I'm analyzing our product portfolio profitability and need help creating a comprehensive analysis workbook. Here's the data for our five product lines over the past year:\n\n**Product A (Premium Tier):**\n- Units Sold: 8,500\n- Average Selling Price: $299\n- Unit Cost: $145\n- Fixed Costs (annual): $425,000\n- Marketing Spend: $185,000\n\n**Product B (Mid Tier):**\n- Units Sold: 15,200\n- Average Selling Price: $149\n- Unit Cost: $82\n- Fixed Costs (annual): $380,000\n- Marketing Spend: $225,000\n\n**Product C (Entry Tier):**\n- Units Sold: 22,800\n- Average Selling Price: $79\n- Unit Cost: $45\n- Fixed Costs (annual): $290,000\n- Marketing Spend: $165,000\n\n**Product D (Professional Tier):**\n- Units Sold: 4,300\n- Average Selling Price: $599\n- Unit Cost: $310\n- Fixed Costs (annual): $520,000\n- Marketing Spend: $295,000\n\n**Product E (Enterprise Tier):**\n- Units Sold: 1,850\n- Average Selling Price: $1,299\n- Unit Cost: $680\n- Fixed Costs (annual): $485,000\n- Marketing Spend: $340,000\n\nCreate a multi-sheet workbook with the following analyses:\n\n1. **Product Data** sheet: Organize all raw product data in a structured table with columns for Product Name, Units Sold, Avg Selling Price, Unit Cost, Fixed Costs, and Marketing Spend.\n\n2. **Profitability Analysis** sheet: Calculate for each product using formulas (no hardcoded calculations): Total Revenue, Total Variable Costs, Contribution Margin (in dollars and as %), Total Costs (Variable + Fixed + Marketing), Net Profit, Net Profit Margin %, Break-even Units (Fixed Costs + Marketing / Contribution per Unit), and Return on Marketing Investment ((Net Profit / Marketing Spend) * 100).\n\n3. **Portfolio Summary** sheet: Create a company-wide view showing total revenue across all products, total costs across all products, overall company profit, each product's percentage contribution to total company revenue, and each product's percentage contribution to total company profit. Rank products by profitability using Excel ranking functions.\n\n4. **Scenario Analysis** sheet: Model the impact of a 10% price increase scenario for each product. Create assumption cells for price adjustment percentages (initially set all to 10%). Calculate new revenue, new contribution margin, and incremental profit change assuming unit volume decreases by 5% for every 10% price increase (use elasticity formula). Show side-by-side comparison of current vs. scenario metrics.\n\n5. **Strategic Recommendations** sheet: Using formulas, identify which product has the highest profit margin, which has the lowest break-even point, which generates the most absolute profit, and which has the best marketing ROI. Calculate the weighted average profit margin for the portfolio (weighted by revenue).\n\nAll monetary calculations must use Excel formulas referencing appropriate cells - absolutely no Python-calculated hardcoded values. Apply financial modeling standards: blue text for all input values, black text for formulas, green text for any cross-sheet references. Format currency with thousand separators and specify units in headers (e.g., 'Revenue ($)'). Display all zeros as dashes. Format percentages to one decimal place. Place all assumptions (elasticity factors, scenario adjustments) in separate labeled cells. The workbook must pass validation with zero formula errors after recalculation.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. All five sheets are created with correct names (Product Data, Profitability Analysis, Portfolio Summary, Scenario Analysis, Strategic Recommendations) and contain the required calculations and metrics as specified.\n2. The Profitability Analysis sheet correctly calculates all eight metrics for each product (Total Revenue, Total Variable Costs, Contribution Margin $, Contribution Margin %, Total Costs, Net Profit, Net Profit Margin %, Break-even Units, ROMI) using formulas.\n3. The Portfolio Summary sheet includes company-wide totals, percentage contributions by product, and ranking by profitability, while the Scenario Analysis sheet models price increase impacts with elasticity-adjusted volume changes.\n4. The Strategic Recommendations sheet uses formulas to identify the highest profit margin product, lowest break-even product, highest absolute profit product, best marketing ROI product, and calculates the revenue-weighted average profit margin for the portfolio.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The xlsx skill is selected and identified as relevant for creating a multi-sheet financial analysis workbook with complex formulas and formatting requirements.\n2. The SKILL.md file for the xlsx skill is loaded to access guidelines on formula construction, color coding standards, number formatting, and recalculation procedures.\n3. The recalc.py script is loaded and used to recalculate all formulas in the workbook and verify zero formula errors after creation.\n4. The skill is used appropriately by: (a) using openpyxl to create formulas rather than hardcoding calculated values, (b) applying proper financial modeling color conventions (blue for inputs, black for formulas, green for cross-sheet references), (c) formatting currency and percentages according to standards, (d) placing assumptions in separate cells, (e) running recalc.py to validate the workbook has zero formula errors, and (f) using Excel functions like RANK for ranking operations.",
