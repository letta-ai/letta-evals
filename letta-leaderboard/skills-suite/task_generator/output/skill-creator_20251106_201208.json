  "task": "I lead a cybersecurity team that regularly performs penetration testing reports for clients. Our workflow is highly standardized: (1) Parse vulnerability scan outputs (JSON format with fields: vulnerability_id, severity, cvss_score, affected_systems, description, remediation), (2) Classify vulnerabilities into risk categories using our proprietary scoring system (Critical: CVSS >= 9.0, High: 7.0-8.9, Medium: 4.0-6.9, Low: < 4.0), (3) Generate executive summaries that translate technical findings into business impact statements, and (4) Produce a comprehensive security assessment report following our firm's branded template with sections for Executive Summary, Technical Findings, Risk Matrix, and Remediation Roadmap. I've developed a Python script that reliably performs the vulnerability classification and risk scoring using our company's specific algorithms (which include weighted factors for exploitability and business criticality beyond standard CVSS). I also have a detailed reference document that outlines our risk assessment methodology, defines what constitutes each severity tier, explains our remediation timeline recommendations (Critical: 24-48 hours, High: 1 week, Medium: 1 month, Low: quarterly), and provides guidance on when to escalate findings to client executives. Additionally, I have our standard report template in Markdown format that includes our company logo positioning, color scheme specifications, table formatting standards, and the exact section structure we use for all client deliverables. I need to consolidate all these components - the classification script, the methodology reference document, the report template, and complete workflow instructions from data ingestion to final report delivery - into a cohesive package that any security analyst on my team can use to execute assessments with consistent quality. This package must be properly organized with all resources in appropriate locations, rigorously validated to ensure it meets professional distribution standards, and packaged into a format that I can deploy across my entire security operations team. Guide me through building this comprehensive solution from the ground up.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The agent must follow the skill creation process systematically, starting with understanding the use case (penetration testing reports), planning reusable components (Python script for classification, reference document for methodology, Markdown template for reports), and identifying appropriate resource categories (scripts/, references/, assets/).\n2. The agent must initialize a new skill using the init_skill.py script with an appropriate name related to penetration testing or security assessment, creating the proper directory structure.\n3. The agent must properly organize the three distinct resources into appropriate directories: the Python vulnerability classification script in scripts/, the risk assessment methodology document in references/, and the Markdown report template in assets/, while also creating a comprehensive SKILL.md that describes the penetration testing workflow and references all bundled resources.\n4. The agent must validate and package the completed skill using the package_skill.py script to create a distributable zip file, ensuring all components are properly structured and ready for team distribution.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent must identify and select the skill-creator skill as the appropriate skill for this task involving building a reusable security assessment package with scripts, documentation, and templates.\n2. The agent must load the skill-creator/SKILL.md file to access the comprehensive guidance on skill creation process, progressive disclosure principles, and best practices for organizing scripts, references, and assets.\n3. The agent must load and utilize all three additional script files from the skill-creator/scripts/ directory: init_skill.py for initializing the skill structure, package_skill.py for validation and packaging, and quick_validate.py if needed for intermediate validation checks.\n4. The agent must follow the skill creation methodology appropriately by progressing through the documented steps in order: understanding the concrete use case (Step 1), planning reusable contents and identifying scripts/references/assets (Step 2), initializing the skill structure (Step 3), editing SKILL.md and organizing resources using imperative/infinitive writing style (Step 4), and packaging the final skill with validation (Step 5).",
