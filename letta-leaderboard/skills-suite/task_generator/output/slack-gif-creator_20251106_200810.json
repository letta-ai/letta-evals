  "task": "Create an animated GIF for Slack messages that shows a computer monitor with code appearing line-by-line on the screen, simulating someone typing code. Start with an empty dark screen, then have lines of colorful syntax-highlighted code appear sequentially from top to bottom (you can use simple colored rectangles to represent code lines - green, blue, yellow, and white colors work well). Each line should slide in from the left with a slight overshoot effect, like they're being typed with emphasis. After 6-8 lines have appeared, have a green checkmark or success indicator fade in at the bottom right corner of the monitor. The whole animation should be about 3 seconds long and optimized for 480x480 dimensions to use in Slack message threads. Make sure the final file is under 2MB and verify it meets the requirements before finishing. Use a dark background to make it look like a real code editor.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The GIF shows a monitor/screen with code lines appearing sequentially in a typing simulation effect\n2. The code lines slide in from the left with overshoot effect and use multiple colors (green, blue, yellow, white) to simulate syntax highlighting\n3. A success indicator (checkmark or similar) appears after the code lines, using a fade-in effect\n4. The final GIF file is verified to be under 2MB and meets Slack message GIF requirements (around 480x480 dimensions, appropriate for message use)",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The slack-gif-creator skill is selected for creating the animated GIF\n2. The SKILL.md file from slack-gif-creator is loaded to understand animation primitives and optimization strategies\n3. At least 3-4 core files are loaded and used, including gif_builder.py, validators.py, slide.py (for slide-in effects), fade.py (for checkmark appearance), and frame_composer.py or easing.py for visual composition and motion\n4. The skill's components are used appropriately: GIFBuilder for assembly, slide animation primitives for code line effects, fade animation for success indicator, validators to check file size compliance, and easing functions for smooth overshoot motion",
