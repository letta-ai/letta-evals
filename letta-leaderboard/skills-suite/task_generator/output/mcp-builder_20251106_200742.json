  "task": "I need to build a TypeScript-based integration that connects AI assistants to the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api). This weather service provides current weather data, forecasts, and air quality information for locations worldwide.\n\nCreate a server that exposes these tools:\n1. Get current weather for a city by name or coordinates (lat/lon)\n2. Get 5-day weather forecast with 3-hour intervals for a location\n3. Get air quality index and pollutant data for coordinates\n4. Search for cities by name to get their coordinates (useful for disambiguation)\n\nThe tools should support both JSON and Markdown output formats, handle API rate limiting gracefully (the free tier allows 60 calls/minute), and return temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. Each tool needs detailed documentation explaining parameters, return values, and usage examples. Design error messages that help the AI understand what went wrong - for example, if coordinates are out of range or a city name returns no results.\n\nFor authentication, the API requires an API key passed as the 'appid' query parameter. The server should read this from an environment variable called OPENWEATHER_API_KEY.\n\nAfter implementation, create 10 evaluation questions that test whether an AI can effectively combine these tools to answer complex weather-related queries. Questions should require multiple tool calls and exploration - like finding the city with the best air quality among several options, or determining when it will be warmest during the next 5 days in a specific location.\n\nBuild this following professional standards for this type of service integration, including proper schema validation, consistent error handling, and well-structured responses.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. A complete TypeScript MCP server is implemented with all four required tools: current weather by city/coordinates, 5-day forecast, air quality data, and city search functionality\n2. The server includes proper input validation using Zod schemas, supports both JSON and Markdown output formats, handles temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, and reads API key from OPENWEATHER_API_KEY environment variable\n3. Each tool has comprehensive documentation including parameter descriptions, return value schemas, usage examples, and clear error messages that guide the AI toward correct usage\n4. An evaluation file is created containing exactly 10 complex, realistic, read-only questions that require multiple tool calls and have single verifiable answers, following the proper XML format with <evaluation> and <qa_pair> tags",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The mcp-builder skill is selected and explicitly loaded to guide the implementation of the TypeScript-based weather API integration\n2. The skill's SKILL.md file is loaded and its four-phase process (Deep Research and Planning, Implementation, Review and Refine, Create Evaluations) is followed throughout the task\n3. The TypeScript Implementation Guide (reference/node_mcp_server.md), MCP Best Practices (reference/mcp_best_practices.md), and Evaluation Guide (reference/evaluation.md) are all loaded and referenced during appropriate phases of development\n4. The implementation demonstrates proper application of skill guidance including: agent-centric design principles, Zod schema validation, proper tool registration with server.registerTool, tool annotations (readOnlyHint, openWorldHint), consistent response formatting, shared utility functions, and evaluation questions that follow all requirements from the evaluation guide",
