  "task": "I'm developing a multi-step registration form on my local machine. The application runs on port 8080 with the command 'python -m http.server 8080' from the /tmp/registration-app directory. The form has three steps:\n\nStep 1: User enters their name and email\nStep 2: User selects their country from a dropdown and enters their phone number\nStep 3: User reviews their information and clicks a final submit button\n\nEach step has a \"Next\" button to proceed, and the final step shows a success message after submission.\n\nI need you to:\n1. Start the server and navigate to the application at http://localhost:8080\n2. Take a screenshot of the initial state showing Step 1\n3. Fill in the name field with \"Jane Smith\" and email field with \"jane@example.com\"\n4. Click the \"Next\" button to proceed to Step 2\n5. Take a screenshot showing Step 2 is now visible\n6. Select \"Canada\" from the country dropdown and enter \"555-0123\" in the phone number field\n7. Click the \"Next\" button to proceed to Step 3\n8. Take a screenshot showing the review page with all entered information\n9. Click the \"Submit\" button to complete the registration\n10. Wait for the success message to appear and capture a final screenshot\n11. Verify that the success message contains the text \"Registration Complete\"\n12. Report all console messages that occurred during the entire flow\n\nProvide all screenshots, a summary of the registration flow, confirmation that each step transitioned correctly, and any console errors or warnings that appeared.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. Server was started and the application was accessed at http://localhost:8080 with at least 4 screenshots captured (initial state, Step 2, Step 3 review page, and success message)\n2. All form fields were correctly filled across the three steps (name=\"Jane Smith\", email=\"jane@example.com\", country=\"Canada\", phone=\"555-0123\") and navigation buttons were clicked to progress through each step\n3. The final screenshot demonstrates that the success message appeared and the response confirms verification that the text \"Registration Complete\" was found in the success message\n4. Console messages from the entire flow were captured and reported, along with a summary confirming that each step transition worked correctly",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The webapp-testing skill was selected to handle the task of testing a local web application with server management and browser automation\n2. The webapp-testing/SKILL.md file was loaded to access instructions for using with_server.py and writing Playwright automation scripts\n3. The with_server.py helper script was utilized with --help first, then invoked to manage the server lifecycle while running the Playwright automation script\n4. A Playwright script was written following the skill's best practices including: launching chromium in headless mode, waiting for networkidle state before interactions, using appropriate selectors for form fields and buttons, capturing screenshots at key steps, collecting console messages, and following the reconnaissance-then-action pattern for multi-step interactions",
