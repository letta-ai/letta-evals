  "task": "I need to analyze our sales pipeline data and create a comprehensive dashboard. Here's the raw data:\n\n**Pipeline Data (Monthly, Q1 2024):**\n- January: 45 leads, 12 qualified opportunities, 8 proposals sent, 3 closed deals, $125K revenue\n- February: 52 leads, 15 qualified opportunities, 10 proposals sent, 5 closed deals, $189K revenue\n- March: 61 leads, 18 qualified opportunities, 13 proposals sent, 7 closed deals, $243K revenue\n\n**Rep Performance Data:**\n- Sarah: 5 deals, $198K, avg deal size $39.6K\n- Mike: 4 deals, $152K, avg deal size $38K\n- Jennifer: 6 deals, $207K, avg deal size $34.5K\n\nCreate a sales analytics workbook with the following:\n\n1. **Pipeline Metrics** sheet: Show monthly data with calculated conversion rates at each stage (Lead\u2192Qualified %, Qualified\u2192Proposal %, Proposal\u2192Closed %). Include month-over-month growth rates for each metric.\n\n2. **Rep Performance** sheet: Display rep data with formulas calculating total revenue, deal count, average deal size, and rank by total revenue (use RANK function).\n\n3. **Executive Dashboard** sheet: Pull key metrics from other sheets including Q1 totals, overall conversion rates, top performer, and quarter-over-quarter projections assuming current growth trends continue.\n\nAll calculations must use formulas that reference the data cells - no hardcoded calculations. Format currency in thousands with '$XXXk' notation, percentages to one decimal place, and ensure zeros display as dashes. Use conditional formatting to highlight the top performer in green. The workbook must have zero formula errors when complete.",
  "rubric_task_completion": "1. The workbook contains three sheets (Pipeline Metrics, Rep Performance, Executive Dashboard) with all requested data properly organized and labeled.\n2. All conversion rates, growth rates, rankings, and aggregate calculations are present and implemented using Excel formulas (not hardcoded values), with proper cell references linking between sheets where needed.\n3. Number formatting is correctly applied: currency displays in thousands format (e.g., '$125k'), percentages show one decimal place (e.g., '26.7%'), zeros appear as dashes, and conditional formatting highlights the top performer.\n4. The Excel file contains zero formula errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #N/A, #NAME?) and all formulas calculate correctly when the file is opened.",
  "rubric_skill_use": "1. The agent identifies and selects the 'document-skills/xlsx' skill as the appropriate skill for this spreadsheet creation and analysis task.\n2. The agent loads the SKILL.md file from the 'document-skills/xlsx' skill to access instructions on spreadsheet creation, formula usage, and formatting conventions.\n3. The agent loads and uses the recalc.py script to recalculate all formulas and verify zero formula errors in the completed workbook.\n4. The agent correctly applies the skill's guidelines by using openpyxl to create formulas (not hardcoding calculated values), applying proper number formatting conventions, running recalc.py to verify formulas, and checking for formula errors before finalizing the file.",
