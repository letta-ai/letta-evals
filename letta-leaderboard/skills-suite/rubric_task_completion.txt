Here is the rubric with multiple criteria for evaluating task completion for this task:
{{rubric_task_completion}}

Each criterion is binary with a score of either 0 or 0.25.
The final score should thus be one of [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] based on how many criterion are satisfied.

IMPORTANT: Be critical with your evaluation. Make sure to clearly express your rationale and scoring.
