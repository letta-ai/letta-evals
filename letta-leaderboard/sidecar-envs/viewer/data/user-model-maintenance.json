Can you help me flesh those out?\n\nRequired JSON keys:\n- user_id, name, current, history, last_updated\ncurrent.employer, current.role, current.location {city,country,timezone}, current.preferences {communication_style[], tools[], notes}\nhistory entries only for employer/role/location/timezone changes.\nOutput a single JSON object only (no code fences).",
