That fails the criterion.\n\n2) Required schema (0/0.25): While all top-level keys are present, several values do not match the expected schema. 'open_todos' should be an array of objects with task/owner/priority/status but are plain strings. 'artifacts' should be objects with type/path/description but are strings. This violates the required structure.\n\n3) Correct carry-forward (0/0.25): The submission includes the main decisions and the two core open todos, but it diverges from the ground truth in next_steps (the expected 'Implement hero animation' is missing from next_steps). The rubric requires matching decisions, open todos, and next steps with no key items missing; this mismatch fails the criterion.\n\n4) Correct discard (0/0.25): The ground truth discarded only the weekend hiking chat. The submission's 'discarded' list includes multiple items (Slate palette, default system font, scrolling header behavior) that do not match the ground truth discard list. Therefore this criterion is not satisfied.\n\nBecause all four binary criteria failed, the final score is 0.0."

And the benchmarks I found show comparable performance for our scale.\nKai: Fair enough. Let's go with SLIME then and we can always revisit if it doesn't work out.\nPriya: Cool.

We should flesh that out into a proper training plan though, with data splits, hyperparameters, timeline, all that.\nPriya: Yeah I'll draft up a full plan. The other thing I want to verify is whether SGLang is properly integrated in the letta server. I saw some import references in the codebase but haven't confirmed it works end to end.\nKai: Good point, that's pretty important if we want the inference path to actually function. Can you check that?\nPriya: I was going to, but... so the GCP instance we were using is down.\nKai: Wait seriously? What happened?\nPriya: Something about a billing issue. The billing alert triggered and auto-suspended the instance. I pinged infra about it but they said it might take a day or two to get resolved.\nKai: That's a blocker for basically everything then. We can't run any training or even test SGLang without a GPU instance.\nPriya: Right. I can at least work on the plan doc and do local code review in the meantime.\nKai: True. Oh hey, can you order coffee for the team while you're at it? We're completely out of the dark roast.\nPriya: Haha sure, I'll put in an order this afternoon.\nKai: Thanks.

I think SLIME is the better starting point.\nKai: Why SLIME over rLLM? I thought rLLM had better documentation.\nPriya: The docs are better, yeah, but SLIME's integration with our existing stack is much smoother. And the benchmarks I found show comparable performance for our scale.\nKai: Fair enough. Let's go with SLIME then and we can always revisit if it doesn't work out.\nPriya: Cool. I started putting together some notes in the planning doc. Let me grab the link... here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j38hm-2e0uM00f9LhLcoIp1z4lY8kXMTEIBpew-EQ4s/edit\nKai: Bookmarked. We should flesh that out into a proper training plan though, with data splits, hyperparameters, timeline, all that.\nPriya: Yeah I'll draft up a full plan. The other thing I want to verify is whether SGLang is properly integrated in the letta server. I saw some import references in the codebase but haven't confirmed it works end to end.\nKai: Good point, that's pretty important if we want the inference path to actually function. Can you check that?\nPriya: I was going to, but... so the GCP instance we were using is down.\nKai: Wait seriously? What happened?\nPriya: Something about a billing issue. The billing alert triggered and auto-suspended the instance. I pinged infra about it but they said it might take a day or two to get resolved.\nKai: That's a blocker for basically everything then. We can't run any training or even test SGLang without a GPU instance.\nPriya: Right. I can at least work on the plan doc and do local code review in the meantime.\nKai: True. Oh hey, can you order coffee for the team while you're at it? We're completely out of the dark roast.\nPriya: Haha sure, I'll put in an order this afternoon.\nKai: Thanks. Okay let me know when the GCP situation gets resolved.\n\nOutput `handoff.json` as a single JSON object only (no code fences) with keys:\nsummary, decisions, open_todos, blockers, next_steps, artifacts, discarded.",
