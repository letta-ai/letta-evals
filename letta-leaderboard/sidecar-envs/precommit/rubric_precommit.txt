Here is the rubric with multiple criteria for evaluating whether enforceable preferences were converted into config changes rather than prose memory.

Use the Expected Answer (Ground Truth) JSON as the target to compare against.

Each criterion is binary with a score of either 0 or 0.25.
The final score should thus be one of [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] based on how many criteria are satisfied.

Criteria:
1. **Valid JSON only**: The submission is a single valid JSON object with required keys (config_changes, memory_notes, discarded) and correct types.
2. **Correct config changes**: Enforceable preferences are placed in config_changes with appropriate file targets. No key enforceable item is missing.
3. **Correct memory notes**: Subjective or non-enforceable preferences are placed in memory_notes and not in config_changes.
4. **Correct discard**: Preferences already enforced or irrelevant are listed under discarded and not duplicated elsewhere.

IMPORTANT: Be critical with your evaluation. Make sure to clearly express your rationale and scoring.
