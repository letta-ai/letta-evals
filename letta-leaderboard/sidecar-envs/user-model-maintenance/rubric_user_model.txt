Here is the rubric with multiple criteria for evaluating whether the user model was updated correctly.

Use the Expected Answer (Ground Truth) JSON as the target to compare against.

Each criterion is binary with a score of either 0 or 0.25.
The final score should thus be one of [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] based on how many criterion are satisfied.

Criteria:
1. **Valid JSON only**: The submission is a single valid JSON object with no extra text or code fences.
2. **Required schema**: The JSON includes all required keys and structure as specified (user_id, name, current, history, last_updated; current.employer/role/location/timezone/preferences; preferences.communication_style/tools/notes).
3. **Correct current facts**: The `current` values match the ground truth (no stale facts left as current).
4. **Correct history**: Any replaced facts are recorded in `history` with correct old_value and new_value per the ground truth.

IMPORTANT: Be critical with your evaluation. Make sure to clearly express your rationale and scoring.
