Right now they're scattered across a few different repos and it's getting messy.\nBob: Yeah I noticed that too. What about putting them under letta-leaderboard? That way they're close to the eval infrastructure.\nAlice: Makes sense. We could do letta-leaderboard/sidecar-envs as the root, and then each env gets its own subfolder.\nBob: I like that. Let's go with that structure.\nAlice: Cool. Other thing - I've been updating the smoke suite. We were pointing at localhost before, but now that the cloud API is stable we should probably just default everything to https://api.letta.com/\nBob: Oh right, yeah that makes way more sense for CI. Did you already update the yaml?\nAlice: Yeah I pushed a change to suite_smoke.yaml. Also threw in a couple more baseline models while I was at it - we had too few for meaningful comparison.\nBob: Nice. Where's the suite file now?\nAlice: letta-leaderboard/sidecar-envs/user-model-maintenance/suite_smoke.yaml. And the dataset is at letta-leaderboard/sidecar-envs/user-model-maintenance/data/dataset_full.jsonl\nBob: Got it. Have you actually run the full suite end to end yet?\nAlice: Not yet, that's still on my list. Need to do a full run and get the scores recorded somewhere.\nBob: We should also bump up the dataset size. How many samples are in it right now?\nAlice: Like 8 I think? We should probably get it to at least 20 for any kind of statistical significance.\nBob: Agreed. Oh hey totally unrelated but did you see the email about lunch? They're bringing in tacos on Friday.\nAlice: Oh nice, I saw that. Also apparently they restocked the snack shelf with those fancy chips everyone was asking about.\nBob: lol okay well I'll probably come in for that alone.

I think we should go with the Garnet palette - the warm tones feel more inviting than the Slate option.\nJake: Let me pull up the Figma. You're talking about landing-v3 right?\nMaya: Yeah, figma://project/landing-v3. Compare slides 3 and 4.\nJake: Oh yeah the Garnet definitely pops more. What about the typography though? I feel like the default system font looks a bit bland next to those colors.\nMaya: I was playing around with S\u00f6hne and it pairs really well with the warm palette. Has that nice geometric feel without being too sterile.\nJake: S\u00f6hne it is. Now what about the header behavior on mobile? I had it scrolling away but on smaller screens you lose the nav context pretty fast.\nMaya: I think we should keep it sticky on mobile. The nav is essential and people shouldn't have to scroll all the way back up just to navigate.\nJake: Makes sense. I'll update the branch - I've got everything on feature/redesign-landing.\nMaya: Perfect. Oh, the hero section still needs that parallax animation we talked about last week. I haven't started on that yet.\nJake: Right, that's a big one. Also, I noticed on the staging build that the mobile nav dropdown is overlapping with the hero content. Have you seen that?\nMaya: Ugh, yeah. That's been there since the last merge. We need to fix that before anything else ships, it's pretty broken looking.\nJake: Oh speaking of the nav, we're still waiting on the new logo from the design team right? I can't really finalize the header layout until we have the actual SVG dimensions.\nMaya: Yeah, I pinged Sarah about it yesterday. She said it's still in review but gave no ETA. That's kind of holding up the whole header area.\nJake: Annoying. Well at least we can work around it for the hero animation stuff. Hey did you end up going on that hike last weekend?\nMaya: We did! The trail up Mt. Wilson was gorgeous. Perfect weather for it too.\nJake: Nice, I've been wanting to do that one. My dog would love it.

Users keep reporting that the memory panel shows old data even after they update blocks.\nDev2: Which component handles the memory display? Is that MemoryViewer?\nDev1: Yeah. I added some logging and I think the problem is it's reading from the agentState cache instead of making a fresh API call.\nDev2: Oh wait, so when you open the panel it just grabs whatever agentState has cached from the last render?\nDev1: Exactly. If you updated memory through the API or through another tab, the MemoryViewer still shows the stale version. It never refetches.\nDev2: That's definitely the bug then. We should just make it fetch fresh memory blocks every time you open the panel.\nDev1: Yeah that's what I'm thinking. The overhead of an extra API call on panel open is negligible compared to the confusion it causes.\nDev2: Agreed, let's go with that. Hey have you seen PR #9240? Tim's logprobs branch is getting huge.\nDev1: I saw the notification, but that's a completely different area from what we're looking at. Let's stay focused here.\nDev2: Right, right. So for the memory fix, we should definitely add a regression test. Like, update memory via the API, reopen the panel, assert it shows the fresh value.\nDev1: Good call. I'll write that up. Oh I already filed MEM-217 for tracking.\nDev2: Nice. Think we can get this into the next patch release? The thread in #support is getting pretty active.\nDev1: Yeah we should aim for that.

I think SLIME is the better starting point.\nKai: Why SLIME over rLLM? I thought rLLM had better documentation.\nPriya: The docs are better, yeah, but SLIME's integration with our existing stack is much smoother. And the benchmarks I found show comparable performance for our scale.\nKai: Fair enough. Let's go with SLIME then and we can always revisit if it doesn't work out.\nPriya: Cool. I started putting together some notes in the planning doc. Let me grab the link... here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j38hm-2e0uM00f9LhLcoIp1z4lY8kXMTEIBpew-EQ4s/edit\nKai: Bookmarked. We should flesh that out into a proper training plan though, with data splits, hyperparameters, timeline, all that.\nPriya: Yeah I'll draft up a full plan. The other thing I want to verify is whether SGLang is properly integrated in the letta server. I saw some import references in the codebase but haven't confirmed it works end to end.\nKai: Good point, that's pretty important if we want the inference path to actually function. Can you check that?\nPriya: I was going to, but... so the GCP instance we were using is down.\nKai: Wait seriously? What happened?\nPriya: Something about a billing issue. The billing alert triggered and auto-suspended the instance. I pinged infra about it but they said it might take a day or two to get resolved.\nKai: That's a blocker for basically everything then. We can't run any training or even test SGLang without a GPU instance.\nPriya: Right. I can at least work on the plan doc and do local code review in the meantime.\nKai: True.

We already have the acme-logs bucket set up. We could just do s3://acme-logs/raw as the ingestion target.\nLin: That works. And for the processed output format? Last time we used CSV but it was a nightmare once files got over a few gigs.\nOmar: Yeah CSV is out. I'd say parquet - it's columnar, compresses well, and basically everything downstream can query it directly.\nLin: Parquet makes sense. I had a project last year where we tried Avro and it was painful for ad-hoc analytics queries.\nOmar: Ha, yeah parquet is definitely the way to go for our use case. So we'll need an ETL script to handle the raw-to-parquet transformation. I can write that, probably a Python script using pyarrow.\nLin: Cool. And then we need to schedule it. Daily cadence should be fine for now right?\nOmar: Yeah daily. I'll set up a DAG in Airflow for it. Oh wait actually, do we have the AWS credentials set up for the staging environment?\nLin: Hmm, I don't think so. I tried to access the staging bucket last week and got access denied.\nOmar: That's going to be a problem. We can't really test the pipeline end to end without staging access.\nLin: Yeah, I'll file a request with the cloud team today. Hopefully it's just an IAM policy update.\nOmar: In the meantime I updated the pipeline config with the bucket paths and schema definitions. It's at infra/config/pipeline.yaml.\nLin: Nice.

What are you thinking for v0?\nSara: I think we should use a model_judge rubric approach. It's flexible enough that we can iterate on the criteria without having to change any infrastructure.\nNate: Makes sense. Definitely better than trying to write brittle string-matching checks or regex patterns.\nSara: Exactly. One thing I feel strongly about though - the output format needs to be raw JSON only. No markdown code fences, no extra commentary around it.\nNate: Why raw JSON specifically? Just for parsing simplicity?\nSara: Partially, but it also tests whether the model can follow format instructions precisely. If it wraps the JSON in triple backticks or adds \"Here's the output:\" before it, that should count against it.\nNate: Yeah that's actually a good quality signal. Okay so raw JSON, model_judge rubric. I set up the env folder at letta-leaderboard/sidecar-envs/session-handoff/ already by the way.\nSara: Oh nice. So the next thing is we need to actually write the rubric - you know, the text file with the scoring criteria and the breakdown of what earns full marks vs partial.\nNate: I'll take that on. Shouldn't be too hard now that we've agreed on the grading approach. We also need a smoke suite yaml to run quick sanity checks during development.\nSara: True. Maybe like 3-4 samples in the smoke suite, just enough to make sure the pipeline doesn't blow up before we run the full thing.\nNate: Yeah exactly. Hey random question - do you use emojis in your commit messages? I keep going back and forth on whether that's professional.\nSara: Ha, I used to but I stopped.
