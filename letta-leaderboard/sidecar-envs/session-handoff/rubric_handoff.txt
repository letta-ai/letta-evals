Here is the rubric with multiple criteria for evaluating whether the handoff artifact was produced correctly.

Use the Expected Answer (Ground Truth) JSON as the target to compare against.

Each criterion is binary with a score of either 0 or 0.25.
The final score should thus be one of [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] based on how many criterion are satisfied.

Criteria:
1. **Valid JSON only**: The submission is a single valid JSON object with no extra text or code fences.
2. **Required schema**: The JSON includes all required keys and structure as specified (summary, decisions, open_todos, blockers, next_steps, artifacts, discarded).
3. **Correct carry-forward**: Decisions, open todos, and next steps match the ground truth (no key items missing or contradicted).
4. **Correct discard**: The discarded items match the ground truth (irrelevant/outdated details are not carried forward).

IMPORTANT: Be critical with your evaluation. Make sure to clearly express your rationale and scoring.
