  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly explains the internal structure
    of PPTX files.


    Key facts about PPTX structure:

    - PPTX files are ZIP archives containing XML files

    - Individual slides are stored in ppt/slides/ (e.g., slide1.xml, slide2.xml)

    - Speaker notes are stored in ppt/notesSlides/ (e.g., notesSlide1.xml)

    - Other important directories include ppt/theme/, ppt/media/, ppt/slideLayouts/,
    ppt/slideMasters/


    Score 1.0 if: Response explains it''s a ZIP archive containing XML, correctly
    identifies the slides location (ppt/slides), AND correctly identifies the notes
    location (ppt/notesSlides or similar)

    Score 0.8 if: Response correctly identifies both the slides and notes locations
    but doesn''t mention ZIP/XML format

    Score 0.6 if: Response correctly identifies the slides location OR explains the
    ZIP+XML format with some directory knowledge

    Score 0.4 if: Response demonstrates basic understanding (ZIP or XML format) but
    lacks specific path knowledge

    Score 0.0 if: Response does not demonstrate understanding of OOXML/PPTX structure
