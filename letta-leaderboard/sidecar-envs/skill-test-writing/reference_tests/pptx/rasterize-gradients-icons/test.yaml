    The response should explain the rasterization requirement:

    1. CRITICAL: Rasterize gradients and icons as PNG images FIRST using Sharp
    2. Then reference the PNG images in HTML
    3. Don't use CSS gradients or SVG icons directly

    Score 0 if suggests using CSS gradients or SVG directly.
    Score 0.5 if mentions images but not the Sharp rasterization step.
    Score 1 if explains must rasterize to PNG first, then reference in HTML.
