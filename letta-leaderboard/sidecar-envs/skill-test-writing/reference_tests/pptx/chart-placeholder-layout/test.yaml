    The response should explain proper chart/text layouts:

    1. Use two-column layout (preferred): header spanning full width, text in one column, chart in other
    2. Or full-slide layout for maximum chart readability
    3. NEVER vertically stack chart below text - causes poor readability

    Score 0 if suggests stacking chart below text.
    Score 0.5 if mentions layout but unclear on preferred approach.
    Score 1 if recommends two-column or full-slide, explicitly warns against vertical stacking.
