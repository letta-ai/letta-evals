  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly explains the auto-clearing behavior
    of replace.py.


    Key behavior:

    - Shapes NOT included in the replacement JSON are automatically cleared/emptied

    - This is the default behavior - all text shapes get blanked unless explicitly
    given content

    - The replacement works based on the inventory structure (slide-X/shape-X)

    - Only shapes with "paragraphs" entries in the JSON retain their content


    Score 1.0 if: Response correctly explains that shapes are automatically cleared/emptied
    AND mentions this is the default/automatic behavior AND connects it to the inventory/paragraphs
    structure

    Score 0.8 if: Response explains the auto-clear behavior and mentions it''s automatic/default

    Score 0.6 if: Response explains clearing behavior with some context about paragraphs

    Score 0.4 if: Response mentions clearing or automatic behavior but lacks complete
    explanation

    Score 0.0 if: Response does not demonstrate understanding of the auto-clear behavior
