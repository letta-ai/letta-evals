    rearrange slides in PowerPoint.


    The ideal solution involves:

    - Using rearrange.py script from the pptx skill

    - Understanding that slides are referenced by 0-based indices

    - Duplicating slides by repeating the same index (e.g., "0,0,1,2" duplicates slide
    0)

    - Removing slides by omitting their indices from the list


    Score 1.0 if: Response recommends rearrange.py AND explains the index-based system
    for reordering/duplicating

    Score 0.8 if: Response recommends rearrange.py with basic usage but incomplete
    index explanation

    Score 0.6 if: Response recommends rearrange.py OR provides a working scripting
    approach with index understanding

    Score 0.4 if: Response demonstrates understanding of programmatic slide manipulation
    concepts (duplicate, remove, indices)

    Score 0.0 if: Response does not provide a practical programmatic approach
