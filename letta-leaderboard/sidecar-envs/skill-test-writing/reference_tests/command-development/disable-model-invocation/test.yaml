  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response demonstrates knowledge of the disable-model-invocation
    frontmatter for preventing programmatic command invocation.


    The response should:

    1. Mention the disable-model-invocation frontmatter field

    2. Show it set to true

    3. Show it in frontmatter context (between --- delimiters)

    4. Explain that this prevents Claude from invoking the command programmatically


    Score 1.0 if: Response shows disable-model-invocation: true in frontmatter and
    explains it prevents programmatic invocation

    Score 0.5 if: Response mentions disable-model-invocation but doesn''t show complete
    frontmatter syntax or clear explanation

    Score 0.0 if: Response doesn''t mention disable-model-invocation or gives an incorrect
    solution
