    location for Claude Code custom commands.


    The response should:

    1. State that commands use Markdown format (.md files)

    2. Specify the correct directory: .claude/commands/

    3. Mention the .md file extension


    Score 1.0 if: Response correctly states commands are Markdown files (.md) stored
    in .claude/commands/ directory

    Score 0.5 if: Response mentions either the Markdown format or the correct directory,
    but not both clearly

    Score 0.0 if: Response gives incorrect format (not Markdown) or wrong directory
    location
