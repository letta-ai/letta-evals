    The response should:

    1. Mention the model: frontmatter field

    2. Recommend Haiku as a faster/cheaper option for simple tasks

    3. Show it in frontmatter context (between --- delimiters)


    Score 1.0 if: Response shows the model: field in frontmatter and recommends Haiku
    (or similar fast/cheap model) for simple tasks

    Score 0.5 if: Response mentions the model field but doesn''t specifically recommend
    a faster/cheaper model like Haiku

    Score 0.0 if: Response doesn''t mention the model frontmatter field or gives an
    incorrect method for model selection
