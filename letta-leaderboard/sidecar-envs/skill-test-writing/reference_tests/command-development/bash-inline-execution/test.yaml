    syntax in Claude Code commands.


    The response should:

    1. Show the !` (exclamation-backtick) syntax for inline bash execution

    2. Demonstrate with the git example or similar command

    3. Explain that the command output is dynamically included


    Score 1.0 if: Response shows the !` syntax (exclamation mark followed by backtick)
    with a git or similar example

    Score 0.5 if: Response explains dynamic execution concept but doesn''t clearly
    show the !` syntax

    Score 0.0 if: Response doesn''t show the !` syntax for inline bash execution
