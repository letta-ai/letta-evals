    The response should:

    1. Show the $1, $2 (dollar-sign number) syntax for accessing individual arguments

    2. Explain that $1 is the first argument, $2 is the second, etc.

    3. Ideally show an example relevant to the PR/reviewer context


    Score 1.0 if: Response shows both $1 and $2 syntax and demonstrates how to use
    them (e.g., with the PR number and reviewer example)

    Score 0.5 if: Response shows positional argument syntax ($1 or $2) but lacks a
    clear example or only shows one

    Score 0.0 if: Response doesn''t show the $1/$2 positional argument syntax
