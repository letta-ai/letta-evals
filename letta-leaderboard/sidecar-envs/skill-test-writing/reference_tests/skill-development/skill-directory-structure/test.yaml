    The correct answer is:

    1. Create a directory with the skill name (e.g., data-analysis/ or skills/data-analysis/)

    2. The MINIMUM required file is SKILL.md - this is the only file that must exist

    3. Optional directories include: references/, scripts/, examples/, assets/


    Score 1.0 if: Identifies SKILL.md as the required minimum file, shows the directory
    structure clearly, indicates that only SKILL.md is required

    Score 0.5 if: Mentions SKILL.md and shows directory structure, but doesn''t clarify
    it''s the minimum requirement

    Score 0.0 if: Doesn''t mention SKILL.md as required, or suggests other files are
    mandatory
