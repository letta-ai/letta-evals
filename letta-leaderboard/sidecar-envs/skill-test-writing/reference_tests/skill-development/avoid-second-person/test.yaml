    The original text uses second-person language ("You should", "You need to", "You
    can").

    A correct rewrite should:

    1. Remove all second-person pronouns and constructions

    2. Use imperative/infinitive form instead ("Read the configuration file", "Validate
    the input")

    3. Preserve the original meaning and sequence of actions (read config, validate
    input, use API/submit)


    Score 1.0 if: No second-person language, uses imperative form, preserves all three
    actions (read, validate, submit/API)

    Score 0.5 if: Mostly removes second-person (1-2 remaining), preserves the actions

    Score 0.0 if: Still uses heavy second-person language, or loses the original meaning
