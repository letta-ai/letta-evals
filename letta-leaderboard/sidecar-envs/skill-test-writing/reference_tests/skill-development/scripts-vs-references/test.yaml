    scripts/ and references/ directories.


    The correct distinction is:

    1. scripts/ - Contains EXECUTABLE code (Python, Bash, etc.) that Claude can run
    as tools/utilities

    2. references/ - Contains DOCUMENTATION/INFORMATION (markdown files, guides) that
    Claude reads for context


    Score 1.0 if: Correctly explains scripts/ is for executable code (mentions Python/Bash/running/executing)
    AND references/ is for documentation/information to read, with examples

    Score 0.5 if: Gets the basic distinction right but lacks clear examples or explanation

    Score 0.0 if: Confuses the two directories, or doesn''t explain the key difference
    (executable vs readable)
