    example.


    A quality skill example should:

    1. Cover the complete workflow: branch creation, commits, push, and PR creation

    2. Use proper code block formatting (```bash or ```sh)

    3. Include helpful comments explaining each step


    Check for these git operations:

    - Branch creation: git checkout -b or git switch -c

    - Making commits: git commit

    - Pushing: git push

    - Opening PR: gh pr create or equivalent


    Score 1.0 if: Complete workflow (4+ git operations), formatted in code blocks,
    includes explanatory comments

    Score 0.5 if: Most git operations present (3+), proper formatting, but may lack
    comments

    Score 0.0 if: Missing multiple key operations, no code formatting, or not a usable
    example
