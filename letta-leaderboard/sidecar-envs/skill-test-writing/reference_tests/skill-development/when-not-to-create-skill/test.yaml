    The response should identify cases where skills aren't warranted:

    1. One-off tasks that won't be repeated
    2. Simple tasks that don't require specialized knowledge
    3. Tasks where general model knowledge is sufficient
    4. When the overhead of maintaining a skill exceeds the benefit

    Score 0 if says always create skills or doesn't address when NOT to.
    Score 0.5 if mentions one reason but incomplete analysis.
    Score 1 if identifies multiple cases where skills aren't justified (repetition, complexity, maintenance).
