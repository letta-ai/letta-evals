    The response should explain year formatting in Excel:

    1. Excel applies number formatting by default, adding thousands separator
    2. Format years as text strings, not numbers
    3. Use text format or write as string ("2024" not 2024)

    Score 0 if doesn't identify the number formatting issue.
    Score 0.5 if explains the issue but unclear solution.
    Score 1 if recommends formatting years as text to avoid comma.
