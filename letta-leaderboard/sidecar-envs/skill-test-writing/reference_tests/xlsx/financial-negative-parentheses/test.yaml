  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly recommends the finance industry
    standard for displaying negative numbers.


    In professional financial models, negative numbers should be displayed in PARENTHESES,
    not with a minus sign. For example, a loss of $500 should appear as ($500) not
    -$500.


    The ideal Excel number format string uses a semicolon-separated format where the
    second section (negative numbers) uses parentheses, such as: $#,##0;($#,##0) or
    similar patterns.


    Score 1.0 if: Provides a correct Excel format string that uses parentheses for
    the negative section (e.g., $#,##0;($#,##0) or similar).

    Score 0.9 if: Recommends parentheses for negatives and mentions this is the industry/accounting
    standard, but doesn''t provide the exact format string.

    Score 0.8 if: Recommends parentheses and contrasts with the minus sign approach,
    showing understanding of why parentheses are preferred.

    Score 0.6 if: Recommends parentheses for negative numbers but doesn''t connect
    it to industry standards or explain why.

    Score 0.2 if: Mentions financial/accounting conventions but doesn''t specifically
    recommend parentheses.

    Score 0.0 if: Recommends minus signs or doesn''t address the formatting question
    meaningfully.
