prompt: 'Create a financial model Excel file called dcf_model.xlsx with proper

  industry-standard formatting. Include:


  - Row 1: Headers (Year 2024, 2025, 2026)

  - Row 2: Revenue (input value: 1000000 in 2024, formula for 2025/2026 based on growth
  rate)

  - Row 3: Growth Rate (input assumption: 10%)

  - Row 4: EBITDA Margin (input assumption: 25%)

  - Row 5: EBITDA (calculated from Revenue * Margin)


  Apply appropriate color formatting to distinguish between input cells and

  formula cells according to financial modeling best practices.


  Write the Python code to create this file.

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly implements financial model color
    coding conventions.


    The response should demonstrate understanding that in professional financial models:

    - Input cells (hardcoded values, assumptions) should be colored BLUE

    - Formula cells (calculations) should be BLACK or default color

    - The code should use openpyxl''s Font styling to apply colors

    - The spreadsheet should contain actual Excel formulas (e.g., =B2*B3) not just
    static values


    Score 1.0 if: Uses blue font for input cells, includes proper Excel formulas,
    uses openpyxl Font styling, and mentions/applies the industry convention for distinguishing
    inputs from calculations.

    Score 0.8 if: Uses blue for inputs, includes formulas, and uses Font styling,
    but doesn''t explain the convention.

    Score 0.6 if: Uses Font styling with some color awareness and has formulas, but
    may not correctly identify which cells are inputs vs formulas.

    Score 0.2 if: Has formulas in the model but no meaningful color coding.

    Score 0.0 if: No formulas and no color coding - just creates static values.
