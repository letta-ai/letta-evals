  In a financial model, should I put a growth rate directly in formulas like =B5*1.05 or use a separate cell?

    The response should recommend separate assumption cells:

    1. Place assumptions (growth rates, margins) in separate labeled cells
    2. Reference those cells in formulas: =B5*(1+$B$6) not =B5*1.05
    3. Benefits: easier to update, transparent assumptions, scenario analysis

    Score 0 if says hardcoding in formulas is fine.
    Score 0.5 if mentions both approaches without clear recommendation.
    Score 1 if strongly recommends separate assumption cells over hardcoded values.
