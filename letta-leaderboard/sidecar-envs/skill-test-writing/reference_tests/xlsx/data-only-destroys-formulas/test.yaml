prompt: 'I want to read the calculated values from an Excel file using openpyxl.

  I know I can use data_only=True to get calculated values instead of formulas.


  Are there any risks or warnings I should know about when using data_only=True?

  What happens if I modify and save the file after opening with data_only=True?

    The key issue is: When you open an Excel file with data_only=True and then save
    it, the formulas are permanently destroyed and replaced with their last calculated
    values. This is a destructive operation that cannot be undone.


    Score 1.0 if: Clearly explains that formulas will be lost/destroyed/replaced when
    saving after using data_only=True. The connection between saving and formula loss
    must be explicit.

    Score 0.8 if: Warns about formula loss but doesn''t clearly tie it to the save
    operation.

    Score 0.5 if: Mentions data_only context with warning language about saving, but
    doesn''t explicitly state that formulas are lost.

    Score 0.3 if: Has general warning language about saving but doesn''t specifically
    address formula destruction.

    Score 0.0 if: Does not warn about any risks or the response is misleading about
    what happens.
