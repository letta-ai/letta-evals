prompt: 'I''m building a financial model with multiple worksheets. What color coding

  conventions should I use to distinguish between different types of cell content?


  Specifically, how should I visually indicate:

  - Hardcoded input values that users can change

  - Formulas and calculations

  - Links that pull data from other worksheets in the same workbook

  - External links to other files

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly describes the industry-standard
    financial modeling color conventions.


    The four standard colors in professional financial models are:

    - BLUE = hardcoded inputs/assumptions (values users can change)

    - BLACK = formulas and calculations

    - GREEN = cross-worksheet links (references to other sheets within the same workbook)

    - RED = external links (references to other files)


    The GREEN for cross-worksheet links is the key differentiator - this is the most
    obscure convention and demonstrates deep knowledge.


    Score 1.0 if: Correctly identifies all four color conventions (blue for inputs,
    black for formulas, green for same-workbook cross-sheet links, red for external
    file links).

    Score 0.9 if: Gets three conventions correct INCLUDING the green for cross-worksheet
    links.

    Score 0.7 if: Gets three conventions correct but misses or misattributes the green
    cross-worksheet convention, OR gets two correct including green.

    Score 0.5 if: Correctly identifies green for cross-worksheet links but misses
    other conventions, OR gets two conventions correct without green.

    Score 0.2 if: Gets only one convention correct and misses the green cross-worksheet
    rule.

    Score 0.0 if: Does not correctly identify any of the color conventions.
