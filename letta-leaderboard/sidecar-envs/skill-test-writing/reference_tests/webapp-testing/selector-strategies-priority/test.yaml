    The response should recommend stable selector strategies:

    1. Prefer: text=, role=, data-testid, IDs
    2. Avoid: fragile class names, deeply nested CSS, nth-child
    3. Use descriptive selectors that survive UI refactoring

    Score 0 if suggests any selector is fine or recommends fragile approaches.
    Score 0.5 if mentions some strategies but no clear priority.
    Score 1 if recommends stable selectors (text, role, testid) over fragile ones (classes, structure).
