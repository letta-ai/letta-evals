  There's a with_server.py script available. Should I read its source code to understand how to use it?

    The response should recommend checking --help before reading source:

    1. Run the script with --help first to see usage
    2. Don't read source code until you've tried the black-box interface
    3. Large scripts can pollute context window unnecessarily

    Score 0 if recommends reading source first or doesn't mention --help.
    Score 0.5 if mentions --help but doesn't emphasize trying it before reading.
    Score 1 if clearly states: run --help first, only read source if absolutely necessary.
