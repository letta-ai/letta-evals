prompt: 'I''m writing a Playwright automation script to test a web app. When I call

  browser = p.chromium.launch(), what mode should I use - headed or headless?

  Is there a standard recommendation for this testing toolkit?

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly advises using headless mode for
    Playwright Chromium automation.


    The response should demonstrate understanding that headless=True is the recommended
    default for automated testing because:

    - It works in CI/CD environments without a display

    - It''s faster and uses fewer resources

    - It''s the standard for server-side automation


    Score 1.0 if: Response explicitly recommends headless=True AND shows correct code
    syntax (e.g., .launch(headless=True)) AND explains why headless is preferred

    Score 0.7 if: Response recommends headless mode but lacks either the code example
    or the explanation

    Score 0.4 if: Response mentions Chromium and automation concepts but doesn''t
    clearly recommend headless mode

    Score 0.0 if: Response recommends headed mode (headless=False) as the default,
    or fails to address the question
