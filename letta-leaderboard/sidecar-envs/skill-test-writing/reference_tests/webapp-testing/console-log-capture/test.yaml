    The response should explain console log capture in Playwright:

    1. Use page.on('console', callback) to capture console messages
    2. Register listener BEFORE navigating to the page
    3. Can filter by message type (error, warning, log)

    Score 0 if doesn't mention page.on('console').
    Score 0.5 if mentions console capture but incomplete setup.
    Score 1 if explains page.on('console', ...) and emphasizes registering before navigation.
