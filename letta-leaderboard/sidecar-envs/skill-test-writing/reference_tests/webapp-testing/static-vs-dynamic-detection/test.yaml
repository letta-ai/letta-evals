    The response should explain how to distinguish static vs dynamic:

    1. Static: Can read HTML file directly to find selectors
    2. Dynamic: Content rendered by JavaScript, need browser execution
    3. Check for: JS framework indicators, empty content in source, API calls on load

    Score 0 if doesn't explain how to tell the difference.
    Score 0.5 if mentions the distinction but no concrete detection method.
    Score 1 if explains how to detect (check source vs rendered, look for framework indicators).
