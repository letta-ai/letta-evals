  I'm trying to scrape a React app with Playwright but page.content() returns empty divs. What's wrong?

    The response should identify the common SPA/React gotcha:

    1. Must wait for JavaScript to execute and render content
    2. Use page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle') before inspecting DOM
    3. page.goto() returns when HTML loads, not when JS finishes rendering

    Score 0 if doesn't mention waiting for JS/networkidle.
    Score 0.5 if mentions waiting but not specifically networkidle or load state.
    Score 1 if clearly recommends wait_for_load_state('networkidle') before DOM inspection.
