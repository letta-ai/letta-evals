prompt: 'I have a static HTML file at /path/to/test.html that I want to automate with

  Playwright. Do I need to start a web server, or can I navigate directly to the

  file? What URL format should I use?

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly explains how to use Playwright
    with local static HTML files.


    The key insight is that for static HTML files, you can use the file:// protocol
    directly without starting a web server. This is simpler and appropriate for testing
    standalone HTML files.


    Score 1.0 if: Response explains that no server is needed AND shows the file://
    URL format AND includes a code example with page.goto() using file://

    Score 0.7 if: Response correctly mentions file:// protocol and that no server
    is needed, but lacks a complete code example

    Score 0.4 if: Response mentions that you can work with local/static HTML files
    but doesn''t clearly explain the file:// protocol

    Score 0.0 if: Response incorrectly says a server is required, or fails to mention
    the file:// approach
