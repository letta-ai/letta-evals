  them in a hook script?

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly explains the environment variables
    available to Claude Code hooks.


    Key concepts that should be covered:

    - CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT: The path to the plugin directory where the hook is defined

    - CLAUDE_ENV_FILE: The path to an environment file for configuration

    - How to access these variables in a script (e.g., $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT in bash,
    os.environ/getenv in Python)

    - Hooks also receive data via stdin (JSON input with tool/event information)


    Score 1.0 if: Response correctly identifies both CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT and CLAUDE_ENV_FILE
    environment variables AND demonstrates how to use them in a script (e.g., shows
    $VAR syntax, os.environ, or getenv)


    Score 0.5 if: Response identifies at least one of the environment variables correctly
    AND either shows usage syntax OR explains their purpose (plugin path, configuration)


    Score 0.0 if: Response does not identify either specific environment variable,
    or provides incorrect/fabricated variable names without the correct ones
