  about

  matching all tools or using regex patterns?

    Code hooks.


    Key matcher patterns:

    - Pipe (|) to match multiple tools: e.g., "Bash|Write|Edit" matches any of those
    tools

    - Asterisk (*) as wildcard to match all tools

    - Regex patterns may be supported for more complex matching

    - Examples might include: "Bash|Write", "Read|Edit", "mcp__*" for MCP tools


    Score 1.0 if: Response correctly explains both the pipe syntax for multiple tools
    AND the asterisk/wildcard for all tools, with concrete examples (e.g., "Bash|Write")


    Score 0.5 if: Response correctly explains either the pipe syntax OR the wildcard
    syntax, with examples or mention of regex pattern support


    Score 0.0 if: Response does not explain any of the specific matcher syntax patterns
    (pipe, asterisk, regex), or provides incorrect syntax
