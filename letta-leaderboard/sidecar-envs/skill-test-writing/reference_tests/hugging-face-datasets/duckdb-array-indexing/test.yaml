  choices[0] or choices[1]? Is DuckDB 0-indexed or 1-indexed for arrays?

    The correct answer is that DuckDB uses 0-based indexing for arrays, so choices[0]
    gets the first element. This is different from PostgreSQL''s 1-based indexing.


    Score 1.0 if: Response correctly states DuckDB uses 0-based indexing (choices[0]
    for first element) and mentions DuckDB specifically.

    Score 0.8 if: Response correctly identifies 0-based indexing but doesn''t explicitly
    mention DuckDB.

    Score 0.3 if: Response discusses DuckDB array handling but gives ambiguous or
    incomplete information about indexing.

    Score 0.0 if: Response incorrectly claims DuckDB uses 1-based indexing, or fails
    to address the indexing question.


    IMPORTANT: The correct answer is 0-based indexing (choices[0] for first element).
    Any response claiming 1-based indexing is WRONG and should receive 0.0.
