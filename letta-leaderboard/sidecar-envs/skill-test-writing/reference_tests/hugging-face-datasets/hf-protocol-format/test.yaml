  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly explains the hf:// protocol format
    for accessing Hugging Face datasets in DuckDB.


    The correct format is: hf://datasets/{owner}/{dataset}@~parquet/{config}/{split}/*.parquet


    Key components the response should cover:

    1. The hf:// protocol prefix

    2. The @~parquet revision suffix for parquet file access

    3. The path structure including config and split directories


    Score 1.0 if: Response explains hf:// prefix, @~parquet revision, AND the path
    structure (config/split components).

    Score 0.8 if: Response shows hf:// with either a concrete example path or @~parquet,
    demonstrating practical knowledge.

    Score 0.6 if: Response shows hf:// with datasets path component or config awareness,
    but incomplete.

    Score 0.4 if: Response mentions hf:// protocol exists OR knows about parquet format
    requirement.

    Score 0.0 if: Response does not demonstrate knowledge of the hf:// protocol format.
