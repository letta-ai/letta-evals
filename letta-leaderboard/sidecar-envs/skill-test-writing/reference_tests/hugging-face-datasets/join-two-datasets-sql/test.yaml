    The response should explain the raw SQL command for joins:

    1. Use the "raw" command with full hf:// paths
    2. Syntax: 'hf://datasets/repo1@~parquet/config/split/*.parquet' a JOIN 'hf://...' b
    3. Need to use raw SQL, not the simplified query command

    Score 0 if says joins aren't supported.
    Score 0.5 if mentions SQL joins but not the hf:// path syntax.
    Score 1 if shows using raw command with full hf:// paths for both datasets.
