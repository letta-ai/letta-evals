  What's the difference between a config and a split in HuggingFace datasets?

  prompt: |
    The response should distinguish configs from splits:

    1. Config (subset): Different versions of the dataset (e.g., different languages, task variants)
    2. Split: Train/test/validation partitions within a config
    3. URL format: hf://datasets/repo@~parquet/{config}/{split}/*.parquet

    Score 0 if confuses configs and splits.
    Score 0.5 if explains one but not both.
    Score 1 if clearly distinguishes: config = dataset variant, split = train/test partition.
