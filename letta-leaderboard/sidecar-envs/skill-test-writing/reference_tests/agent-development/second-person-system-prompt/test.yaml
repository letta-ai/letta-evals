    appropriate voice for agent system prompts.


    The correct answer is SECOND PERSON because system prompts address/instruct the
    agent directly.


    A good response should:

    1. Explicitly state "second person" as the correct choice

    2. Provide examples using "you" (e.g., "You are...", "You will...", "Your role
    is...")

    3. Explain WHY second person is correct (you''re addressing/instructing the agent
    directly)


    Score 1.0 if: Correctly identifies second person AND provides "you"-based examples
    AND explains the reasoning (addressing the agent directly)

    Score 0.5 if: Correctly identifies second person with examples but lacks clear
    reasoning, OR shows good "you"-based examples without explicitly naming "second
    person"

    Score 0.0 if: Recommends first or third person, or doesn''t answer the question
    about which person to use
