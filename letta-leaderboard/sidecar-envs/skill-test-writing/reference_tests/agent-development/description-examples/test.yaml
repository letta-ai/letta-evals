    fields and example formats.


    A good response should explain:

    1. The description should include triggering conditions ("Use this agent when...")

    2. Examples should use <example> tags

    3. Examples can include <commentary> tags to explain the example

    4. Examples typically show user/assistant interactions or context

    5. Multiple examples (2-4) help with triggering accuracy


    Score 1.0 if: Mentions <example> tags AND discusses commentary/explanation of
    examples AND covers triggering conditions ("when to use")

    Score 0.5 if: Mentions <example> tags with some context about usage OR discusses
    triggering conditions with multiple examples concept

    Score 0.0 if: Doesn''t mention the example tag format or triggering conditions,
    gives generic advice not specific to Claude Code agents
