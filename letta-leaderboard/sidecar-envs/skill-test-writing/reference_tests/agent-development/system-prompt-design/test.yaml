    for a bug-hunting agent.


    A good system prompt should:

    1. Use second person voice ("You are...", "You will...", "Your task...")

    2. Include a responsibilities/role section

    3. Include process steps or workflow (ideally numbered)

    4. Include output format specification

    5. Be structured with headers (## or **bold**)

    6. Be relevant to bug hunting (mention bugs, errors, issues, vulnerabilities,
    etc.)


    Score 1.0 if: Uses second person voice AND has at least 3 of: responsibilities
    section, process/steps, output format, quality standards. Should be well-structured
    with headers.

    Score 0.5 if: Has reasonable structure with 2+ sections but may use wrong voice
    (first/third person) OR is missing key sections

    Score 0.0 if: Response lacks structure, doesn''t address bug hunting, or is just
    a brief description rather than an actual system prompt
