  description to ensure my agent triggers at the right time?

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response correctly explains how agent triggering works
    and how to write effective descriptions.


    Key points:

    1. The description field determines when Claude triggers/selects an agent

    2. Descriptions should include "Use this agent when..." or similar triggering
    phrases

    3. Concrete examples in the description help Claude match user requests

    4. Different phrasings/variations help cover more cases

    5. Optionally: explaining when NOT to use the agent helps avoid false triggers


    Score 1.0 if: Explains that description determines triggering AND recommends concrete
    examples/use cases AND mentions "use this agent when" format or similar explicit
    trigger phrases

    Score 0.5 if: Explains description''s role in triggering with some practical advice,
    but missing clear guidance on format OR mentions examples without connecting to
    triggering mechanism

    Score 0.0 if: Doesn''t explain that the description field drives agent selection,
    or gives incorrect information about triggering
