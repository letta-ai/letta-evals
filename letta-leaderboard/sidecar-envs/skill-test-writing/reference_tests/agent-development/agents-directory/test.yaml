    be placed and their format.


    The correct answers are:

    1. Agent files go in the "agents/" directory within the plugin

    2. Agent files use Markdown format (.md extension)

    3. Agents are auto-discovered from this directory


    Score 1.0 if: Specifies the agents/ directory AND mentions Markdown/.md format
    AND mentions auto-discovery or that agents are automatically loaded

    Score 0.5 if: Specifies agents/ directory AND Markdown format but doesn''t mention
    auto-discovery, OR gets most details right with minor gaps

    Score 0.0 if: Doesn''t mention the agents/ directory or gives wrong location/format
    information
