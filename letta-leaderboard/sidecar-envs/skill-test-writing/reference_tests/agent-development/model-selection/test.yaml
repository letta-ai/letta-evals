    The question asks which model to use for an agent that does quick code formatting
    checks

    (simple pattern matching, no complex reasoning needed).


    A good response should:

    1. Recommend a lightweight/fast model like Haiku or suggest using "inherit" for
    simple tasks

    2. Explain WHY this choice is appropriate (fast, efficient, cheap, simple tasks
    don''t need heavy models)

    3. Optionally contrast with when you''d use more capable models (Sonnet/Opus for
    complex reasoning)


    Score 1.0 if: Response recommends Haiku or inherit AND provides solid reasoning
    about why lightweight models suit simple tasks (mentions 2+ reasons like: fast,
    quick, simple, cheap, efficient, lightweight)

    Score 0.5 if: Response recommends an appropriate model (Haiku/inherit) but with
    minimal reasoning, OR discusses model tradeoffs without a clear recommendation

    Score 0.0 if: Response recommends using a heavy model for this simple task without
    justification, or doesn''t address model selection at all
