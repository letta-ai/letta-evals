    rules.


    The correct naming rules are:

    - Must be lowercase

    - Hyphens are allowed (for word separation)

    - Length: 3-50 characters

    - Must start and end with alphanumeric characters

    - No underscores


    A good response should cover these key points:

    1. Lowercase requirement

    2. Hyphens allowed for word separation

    3. Length constraints (3-50 characters)


    Score 1.0 if: Mentions lowercase requirement AND hyphens allowed AND length constraints
    (3-50 or similar specific numbers)

    Score 0.5 if: Mentions lowercase AND hyphens but missing length details, OR has
    most rules with minor inaccuracies

    Score 0.0 if: Missing key rules (doesn''t mention lowercase or hyphen conventions),
    or gives incorrect information
