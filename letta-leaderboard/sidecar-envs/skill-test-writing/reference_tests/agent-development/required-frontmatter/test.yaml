    frontmatter fields for Claude Code agents.


    Required fields are:

    - name: the agent identifier

    - description: what the agent does and when to use it

    - model: which LLM model to use

    - color: visual identifier color


    Optional fields include:

    - tools: list of allowed tools (defaults to all tools if omitted)


    Score 1.0 if: Correctly identifies all 4 required fields (name, description, model,
    color) AND mentions that tools is optional or has a default

    Score 0.5 if: Identifies at least 3 required fields AND distinguishes between
    required and optional, but may be missing one field or detail

    Score 0.0 if: Identifies fewer than 2 required fields or doesn''t distinguish
    between required and optional fields
