    A good response should cover:

    1. The "tools" field in frontmatter controls which tools the agent can use

    2. Tools are specified as an array/list

    3. The principle of least privilege - only give agents the tools they need

    4. Common tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit, etc.

    5. Common patterns: read-only agents (just Read, Grep, Glob), testing agents,
    full access agents


    Score 1.0 if: Explains the tools field AND discusses least privilege/restriction
    principle AND mentions 2+ specific tools or tool patterns

    Score 0.5 if: Explains the tools field with examples OR discusses restriction
    concepts without full details

    Score 0.0 if: Doesn''t explain how to restrict tools via the tools field, or gives
    incorrect information
