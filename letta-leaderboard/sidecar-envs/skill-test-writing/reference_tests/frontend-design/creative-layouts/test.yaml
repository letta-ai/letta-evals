  Include a grid of photos with the photographer''s name and bio.


  Use creative, unexpected layout choices - asymmetry, overlapping elements,

  or grid-breaking design rather than a standard symmetric grid.


  Just give me the HTML with inline CSS.

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether this HTML response demonstrates creative, unexpected layout
    choices for a photographer portfolio rather than a standard symmetric grid.


    Key aspects to evaluate:

    1. Does it use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout?

    2. Does it have asymmetric or varied element sizing (grid span, different column
    widths)?

    3. Does it use overlapping elements (position: absolute with z-index)?

    4. Does it use creative positioning (negative margins, transform: translate)?

    5. Does it break the standard grid pattern in interesting ways?


    Score 1.0 if: Uses 2+ creative layout techniques (grid spans with varied sizes,
    overlapping elements with z-index, negative margins, or transform positioning)
    combined with Grid or Flexbox.

    Score 0.8 if: Uses at least one creative technique with CSS Grid.

    Score 0.5 if: Uses CSS Grid with proper grid-template and gap but maintains a
    standard symmetric layout.

    Score 0.3 if: Uses basic Grid or Flexbox without creative variation.

    Score 0.0 if: No modern layout techniques (no Grid or Flexbox).
