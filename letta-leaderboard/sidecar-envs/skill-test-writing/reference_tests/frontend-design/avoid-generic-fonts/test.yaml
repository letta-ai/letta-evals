  prompt: 'Evaluate whether this HTML response avoids generic system fonts and uses
    beautiful, intentional typography for a blog post.


    Key aspects to evaluate:

    1. Does it avoid generic fonts as the primary font choice? Generic fonts to avoid:
    Inter, Arial, Roboto, system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif, Helvetica

    2. Does it load custom fonts from an external source (Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts,
    etc.)?

    3. Does it have font-family declarations that specify named fonts?


    Score 1.0 if: Loads external fonts (Google Fonts via link or @import) and does
    NOT use generic system fonts as the primary font.

    Score 0.5 if: Has font-family declarations but doesn''t load external fonts (or
    uses generic fonts without external alternatives).

    Score 0.3 if: Has some styling but no meaningful typography choices.

    Score 0.0 if: Uses generic system fonts (Inter, Arial, Roboto, system-ui, Helvetica,
    sans-serif) as the primary font.
