  prompt: 'Evaluate whether this HTML response demonstrates creative, distinctive
    typography choices for a coffee shop landing page.


    Key aspects to evaluate:

    1. Does it avoid generic system fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui, sans-serif,
    Helvetica)?

    2. Does it use custom fonts from Google Fonts or similar external font sources?

    3. Does it demonstrate font pairing (different fonts for headings vs body text)?

    4. Are the font choices appropriate for a coffee shop brand (memorable, with character)?


    Score 1.0 if: Uses creative/distinctive fonts (like Playfair, Montserrat, Lora,
    Merriweather, Pacifico, etc.), loads them from external sources, demonstrates
    font pairing with 2+ font-family declarations, and avoids generic system fonts
    entirely.

    Score 0.8 if: Uses creative fonts loaded from Google Fonts, but may still include
    generic fonts as fallbacks.

    Score 0.5 if: Loads external fonts but the choices are not particularly distinctive.

    Score 0.2 if: Has font-family declarations but only uses generic system fonts.

    Score 0.0 if: No meaningful typography styling or only default browser fonts.
