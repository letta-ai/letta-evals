  prompt: 'Evaluate whether this HTML response demonstrates creative animations and
    micro-interactions for hover cards.


    Key aspects to evaluate:

    1. Does it use CSS transitions or @keyframes animations?

    2. Does it have hover states (:hover) with visual feedback?

    3. Does it use transforms (scale, translate, rotate) for effects?

    4. Does it include multiple animation effects (opacity, shadows, transforms)?

    5. Does it use proper timing functions (ease, cubic-bezier)?


    Score 1.0 if: Has @keyframes animations, hover states, 3+ different animation
    effects (scale, translate, rotate, opacity, box-shadow), and proper timing functions.

    Score 0.8 if: Good transitions with hover states and 2+ animation effects.

    Score 0.6 if: Basic hover with transform and transition.

    Score 0.4 if: Has hover states but minimal animation (just basic transition or
    transform).

    Score 0.2 if: Only has simple transitions with no hover interactivity.

    Score 0.0 if: No animations or transitions at all.
