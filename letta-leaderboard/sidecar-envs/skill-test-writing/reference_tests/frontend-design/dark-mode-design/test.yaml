  Design it with a dark theme that feels intentional and polished,

  not just inverted colors.


  Just give me the HTML with inline CSS.

  prompt: 'Evaluate whether this HTML response creates an intentional, polished dark
    theme design rather than just inverted colors.


    Key aspects to evaluate:

    1. Does it use dark backgrounds (dark grays like #1a, #1f, #2d rather than pure
    black #000)?

    2. Does it have light/white text for proper contrast?

    3. Does it use subtle borders (low-opacity or dark-toned rather than harsh)?

    4. Does it have appropriate accent colors that work well on dark backgrounds?

    5. Does it use CSS variables for consistent theming?


    Score 1.0 if: Has dark backgrounds (preferably near-black, not pure black), 3+
    good dark mode practices (light text, subtle borders, accent colors, CSS variables).

    Score 0.8 if: Has dark backgrounds with 2+ good practices.

    Score 0.6 if: Has dark backgrounds with light text but could be more polished.

    Score 0.4 if: Has dark backgrounds but minimal refinement.

    Score 0.0 if: Not a dark theme or uses light backgrounds.
