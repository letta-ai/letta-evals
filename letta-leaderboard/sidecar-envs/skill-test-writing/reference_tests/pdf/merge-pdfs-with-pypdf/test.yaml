prompt: 'Write Python code to merge all PDF files in a directory called "input_pdfs/"

  in alphabetical order by filename.


  Just give me the Python code.

    PDF files using the modern pypdf library.


    The correct approach uses:

    - Modern pypdf (NOT the deprecated PyPDF2)

    - PdfWriter for creating the output

    - PdfReader for reading input files

    - add_page() to add pages to the writer

    - write() to save the output

    - sorted() to ensure alphabetical order


    Score 1.0 if:

    - Uses modern pypdf (import pypdf or from pypdf import)

    - Uses PdfWriter and PdfReader correctly

    - Uses add_page() to add pages

    - Writes output with .write()

    - Sorts files alphabetically


    Score 0.5 if:

    - Uses pypdf correctly but missing alphabetical sorting

    - Has the right components but incomplete implementation


    Score 0.0 if:

    - Uses deprecated PyPDF2 instead of modern pypdf

    - Doesn''t use the correct pattern (PdfWriter/PdfReader/add_page)

    - Fundamentally wrong approach
