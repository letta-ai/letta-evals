  I'm adding a watermark to a PDF but it's covering the text. How do I put the watermark behind the content?

    The response should explain merge order for watermarks:

    1. Use merge_page() with the watermark as the under layer
    2. Call page.merge_page(watermark) - watermark goes under existing content
    3. Alternatively, create watermark with transparency

    Score 0 if doesn't address layer order.
    Score 0.5 if mentions merge but unclear on order.
    Score 1 if explains merge_page puts the argument under the caller page content.
