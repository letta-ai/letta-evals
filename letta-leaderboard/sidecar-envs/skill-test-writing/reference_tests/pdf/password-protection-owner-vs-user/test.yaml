    The response should explain the two password types:

    1. User password: Required to open/view the PDF
    2. Owner password: Required to modify permissions (print, edit, copy)
    3. pypdf's encrypt() takes both: encrypt("userpassword", "ownerpassword")

    Score 0 if doesn't distinguish between the two types.
    Score 0.5 if explains one but not both.
    Score 1 if clearly explains both passwords and their different purposes.
