    cadence for hosted agent systems.


    The key insight is that pre-built images should be rebuilt on a regular cadence
    (around 30 minutes is optimal) to balance:

    - Freshness: keeping images reasonably up-to-date with latest code

    - Startup speed: syncing from a recent image is much faster than building from
    scratch


    Score 1.0 if: Response recommends approximately 30-minute rebuild cadence AND
    explains the rationale (regular/periodic rebuilds enable fast sync at session
    start)

    Score 0.8 if: Response recommends 30-minute cadence but explanation is incomplete,
    OR correctly explains pre-building images with regular cadence without the specific
    timing

    Score 0.6 if: Response understands pre-building images on a schedule but misses
    the specific timing or the sync-speed benefit

    Score 0.4 if: Response mentions 30-minute cadence OR pre-building concept but
    lacks context about why

    Score 0.0 if: Response does not address image rebuild cadence or pre-building
    strategy
