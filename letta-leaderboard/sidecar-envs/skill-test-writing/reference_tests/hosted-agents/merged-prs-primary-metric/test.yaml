    The key insight is that "merged PRs" (or equivalently: merged pull requests, code
    that ships to production) is the primary metric because:

    - It measures actual value delivered (code that made it through review and was
    merged)

    - Session count or usage alone doesn''t indicate whether work was valuable

    - A coding agent''s ultimate purpose is to help ship code


    Score 1.0 if: Response identifies merged PRs/pull requests as the primary metric
    AND explains why it''s the key measure of value

    Score 0.8 if: Response identifies merged PRs as important but doesn''t emphasize
    it as THE primary metric, or lacks full explanation

    Score 0.4 if: Response discusses relevant metrics (approval rate, time to first
    PR, etc.) without identifying merged PRs as primary

    Score 0.2 if: Response focuses on wrong metrics (session count, usage count) as
    primary without mentioning outcome-based metrics

    Score 0.0 if: Response does not address meaningful success metrics
