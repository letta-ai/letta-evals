  How can I reduce the time users wait for their sandbox to be ready?

    The response should explain predictive warm-up:

    1. Start warming the sandbox as soon as user begins typing (not when they submit)
    2. Clone latest changes and run setup in parallel with user composing prompt
    3. Sandbox can be ready before user finishes typing

    Score 0 if only suggests faster hardware or caching.
    Score 0.5 if mentions pre-warming but not triggered by typing.
    Score 1 if describes predictive warm-up starting when user begins typing.
