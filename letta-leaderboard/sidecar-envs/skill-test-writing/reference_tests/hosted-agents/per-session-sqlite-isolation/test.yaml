  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response demonstrates understanding of per-session
    state isolation for hosted agent systems.


    The key insight is that each session should have its own SQLite database (or similar
    isolated storage) so that:

    - No session can impact another session''s state or performance

    - Sessions can scale to hundreds concurrently without contention

    - State is completely isolated between sessions


    Score 1.0 if: Response recommends per-session SQLite (or equivalent isolated file-based
    storage) AND explains the isolation benefit (no cross-session interference)

    Score 0.8 if: Response recommends per-session storage with isolation, even without
    specifically mentioning SQLite, OR mentions SQLite per-session without fully explaining
    isolation benefits

    Score 0.6 if: Response understands isolation is needed for concurrent sessions
    but solution is less specific

    Score 0.4 if: Response mentions isolation or per-session storage but lacks detail
    on implementation or benefits

    Score 0.0 if: Response does not address session isolation or suggests shared storage
    that could cause interference
