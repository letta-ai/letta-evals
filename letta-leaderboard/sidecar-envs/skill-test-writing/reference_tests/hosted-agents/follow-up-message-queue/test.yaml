prompt: |
  Users send messages while the agent is still processing. Should I interrupt the current work or queue the messages?
timeout: 120

grader:
  kind: letta_judge
  prompt: |
    The response should discuss the queue vs insert tradeoff:

    1. Queue approach: Messages wait until current prompt completes
    2. Insert approach: Messages processed immediately
    3. Queueing is simpler, lets users send thoughts on next steps while agent works
    4. Should also build mechanism to stop agent mid-execution when needed

    Score 0 if doesn't address the design decision.
    Score 0.5 if mentions one approach without tradeoffs.
    Score 1 if discusses both approaches and recommends queueing with stop mechanism.
