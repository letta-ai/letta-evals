  In a background agent that commits code, how should I set the git author for commits?
timeout: 120

grader:
  kind: letta_judge
  prompt: |
    The response should explain proper git attribution:

    1. Update git config user.name and user.email when committing
    2. Use the PROMPTING USER's identity, not the app/service identity
    3. Generate GitHub app installation tokens for clone, but attribute commits to user

    Score 0 if suggests using a generic service account for all commits.
    Score 0.5 if mentions setting git config but not user attribution.
    Score 1 if explains commits should be attributed to the prompting user, not the app.
