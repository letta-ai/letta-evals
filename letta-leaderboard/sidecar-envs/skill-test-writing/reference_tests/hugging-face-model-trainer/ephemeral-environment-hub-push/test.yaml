  My HF Jobs training completed successfully but I can't find the model anywhere. What happened?
timeout: 120

    The response should explain the ephemeral environment issue:

    1. Jobs environment is TEMPORARY - all files deleted when job ends
    2. MUST enable push_to_hub=True and set hub_model_id
    3. MUST pass secrets={"HF_TOKEN": "$HF_TOKEN"} for authentication

    Score 0 if doesn't identify the ephemeral environment issue.
    Score 0.5 if mentions Hub push but incomplete setup.
    Score 1 if explains environment is ephemeral and all required settings for Hub push.
