  My long training job might timeout before completion. How can I avoid losing all progress?
timeout: 120

    The response should explain checkpoint saving strategy:

    1. Use save_strategy="steps" with save_steps to create checkpoints
    2. Enable hub_strategy="every_save" to push checkpoints to Hub
    3. This preserves progress even if job times out

    Score 0 if only suggests increasing timeout without checkpointing.
    Score 0.5 if mentions checkpoints but not pushing to Hub.
    Score 1 if explains both saving checkpoints and hub_strategy for persistence.
