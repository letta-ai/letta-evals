prompt: 'I''m trying to run a training job using the hf jobs CLI. I have this command
  but

  it''s not working:


  hf jobs uv run "https://example.com/train.py" --flavor a10g-large --timeout 2h


  What''s wrong with the syntax?

  prompt: 'You are evaluating whether the response correctly identifies the CLI syntax
    error.


    The issue is that CLI flags (like --flavor and --timeout) must come BEFORE the
    script URL, not after it. The script URL should be the last positional argument.
    Flags placed after the script URL will be ignored or cause errors.


    Score 1.0 if: The response clearly explains that flags must come before the script
    URL and shows or implies the correct command structure.

    Score 0.5 if: The response mentions that the script URL should be last, or explains
    that the flags will be ignored/won''t work, but doesn''t clearly state the "flags
    before script" rule.

    Score 0.0 if: The response does not identify the flag ordering issue, or gives
    incorrect advice about the syntax problem.
