    The correct answer is to make minimal, precise edits - only mark what actually
    changes:

    - Only mark "30" as deleted and "60" as inserted

    - Keep unchanged text (like "days" and the rest of the sentence) unmarked

    - This makes reviews easier and maintains document integrity


    Score 1.0 if: Response clearly explains the minimal edit principle (only mark
    what changed) AND emphasizes preserving/keeping unchanged text unchanged.


    Score 0.8 if: Response explains the minimal edit principle AND provides reasoning
    about why (easier review, professional practice, or RSID preservation).


    Score 0.6 if: Response understands the minimal edit principle AND uses the specific
    example (showing 30/60) to illustrate.


    Score 0.4 if: Response understands either the minimal edit principle OR the importance
    of preserving unchanged text, but doesn''t connect both concepts.


    Score 0.0 if: Response suggests replacing the entire sentence or does not demonstrate
    understanding of minimal edit principles for tracked changes.
