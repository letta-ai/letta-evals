timeout: 120

grader:

  prompt: |
    The response should explain [Content_Types].xml:

    1. It's a manifest file that declares MIME types for all parts in the package
    2. Must be updated when adding NEW file types (like images, embedded objects)
    3. Not needed for editing existing text content

    Score 0 if doesn't know what it is or gives wrong information.
    Score 0.5 if general understanding but misses when to modify.
    Score 1 if explains it's a content type manifest and correctly identifies when modification is needed.
