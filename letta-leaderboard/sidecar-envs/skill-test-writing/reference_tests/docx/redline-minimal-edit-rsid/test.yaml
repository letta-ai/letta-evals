prompt: 'When implementing tracked changes in OOXML, I want to change "30 days" to

  "60 days" in a sentence. What''s the best practice for making minimal, precise

  edits rather than replacing the entire sentence?

  '
timeout: 300
grader:
  kind: letta_judge
  prompt: 'Evaluate whether the response demonstrates understanding of minimal edit
    best practices for OOXML tracked changes, particularly regarding RSID preservation.


    Key concepts:

    - Make minimal edits: only mark what actually changes, preserve unchanged text

    - Preserve RSID (revision save ID) for unchanged runs to maintain document history

    - Use w:r (run) elements to break text at edit points

    - Use w:ins/w:del tags for tracked insertions and deletions

    - Avoid replacing entire sentences when only a word changes


    Score 1.0 if: Response explains minimal editing AND mentions RSID preservation
    for unchanged content.


    Score 0.9 if: Response mentions RSID preservation AND discusses w:r (run) elements.


    Score 0.8 if: Response explains minimal editing principle AND describes the pattern
    of breaking/splitting text at edit points (good vs bad approach).


    Score 0.7 if: Response explains minimal editing AND mentions tracked change elements
    (w:ins, w:del).


    Score 0.5 if: Response explains the minimal editing principle but lacks technical
    OOXML details.


    Score 0.3 if: Response only mentions tracked change elements without explaining
    the minimal edit principle.


    Score 0.0 if: Response does not demonstrate understanding of minimal edit principles
    for OOXML tracked changes.
