    The response should explain the distinction:

    1. styles.xml defines reusable named styles (Heading1, Normal, etc.)
    2. Direct formatting (rPr, pPr) in document.xml overrides styles
    3. Best practice: use styles for consistency, direct formatting for exceptions

    Score 0 if doesn't distinguish between the two approaches.
    Score 0.5 if explains one but not the relationship between them.
    Score 1 if explains both and that direct formatting overrides styles.
