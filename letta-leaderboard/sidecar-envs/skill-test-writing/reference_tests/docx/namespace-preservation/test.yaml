  When editing DOCX XML, I'm getting errors about undefined namespace prefixes like w:, r:, etc. What's happening?

    The response should explain XML namespace handling in OOXML:

    1. Namespaces must be declared in the root element (xmlns:w, xmlns:r, etc.)
    2. Common namespaces: w = main wordprocessingML, r = relationships, etc.
    3. When editing, must preserve namespace declarations from original file

    Score 0 if doesn't explain namespace declarations.
    Score 0.5 if mentions namespaces but incomplete explanation.
    Score 1 if explains namespace prefixes must be declared and should be preserved from original.
