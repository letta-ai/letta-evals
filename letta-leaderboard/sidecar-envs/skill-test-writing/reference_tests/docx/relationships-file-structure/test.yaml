    The response should identify the relationships file location:

    1. Relationships are in _rels/ subdirectories
    2. For document.xml, use word/_rels/document.xml.rels
    3. Each relationship has an Id (like rId1) used to reference from the document

    Score 0 if doesn't mention _rels directory or .rels files.
    Score 0.5 if mentions relationships but wrong location.
    Score 1 if correctly identifies word/_rels/document.xml.rels as the location.
