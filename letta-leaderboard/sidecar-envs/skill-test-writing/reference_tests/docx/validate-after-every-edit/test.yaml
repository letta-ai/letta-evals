  I'm editing a DOCX file by modifying the XML directly. When should I run the validate.py script?

    The response should emphasize that validation must happen AFTER EACH individual edit, not just at the end.

    Key points that indicate understanding:
    1. Validate immediately after each edit, not batch validation at the end
    2. Fix validation errors before proceeding to next edit
    3. This prevents cascading errors that are hard to debug

    Score 0 if suggests validating only at the end or periodically.
    Score 0.5 if mentions validation but unclear on timing.
    Score 1 if clearly states validate after EACH edit and fix before continuing.
