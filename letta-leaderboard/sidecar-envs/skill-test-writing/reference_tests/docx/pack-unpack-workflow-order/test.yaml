  What's the correct workflow for editing OOXML files? I have unpack.py, validate.py, and pack.py scripts.

    The response should describe the correct OOXML editing workflow in order:

    1. unpack.py first - extract the OOXML to a directory
    2. Edit XML files
    3. validate.py - check for errors (should happen after edits)
    4. pack.py last - repackage into final file

    Score 0 if order is wrong or missing steps.
    Score 0.5 if general understanding but unclear sequencing.
    Score 1 if clearly explains: unpack -> edit -> validate -> pack.
