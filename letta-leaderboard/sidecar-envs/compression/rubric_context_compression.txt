Here is the rubric with multiple criteria for evaluating whether the compressed context preserves task-critical information.

Use the Expected Answer (Ground Truth) JSON as the target to compare against.

Each criterion is binary with a score of either 0 or 0.25.
The final score should thus be one of [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] based on how many criteria are satisfied.

Criteria:
1. **Valid JSON only**: The submission is a single valid JSON object with required keys (summary, must_keep, constraints, open_questions, safe_to_drop) and correct types.
2. **Correct summary**: The summary captures the main task, decisions, and current status without major omissions.
3. **Correct must_keep/constraints/open_questions**: Critical facts, deadlines, artifacts, and open questions match the ground truth in substance.
4. **Correct safe_to_drop**: Irrelevant or superseded details are correctly listed. No critical items are marked safe_to_drop.

IMPORTANT: Be critical with your evaluation. Make sure to clearly express your rationale and scoring.
