Here is the rubric with multiple criteria for evaluating whether the prompt vs memory split was produced correctly.

Use the Expected Answer (Ground Truth) JSON as the target to compare against.

Each criterion is binary with a score of either 0 or 0.25.
The final score should thus be one of [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] based on how many criteria are satisfied.

Criteria:
1. **Valid JSON only**: The submission is a single valid JSON object with required keys (system_prompt, dynamic_memory, discarded) and correct types.
2. **Correct system_prompt**: Items that are stable and global match the ground truth. No user/project-specific or ephemeral items are incorrectly placed in system_prompt.
3. **Correct dynamic_memory**: User/project/context-specific facts match the ground truth, and each includes a reasonable load_when trigger.
4. **Correct discard**: Ephemeral/irrelevant/malicious items are correctly discarded. No critical items are discarded.

IMPORTANT: Be critical with your evaluation. Make sure to clearly express your rationale and scoring.
