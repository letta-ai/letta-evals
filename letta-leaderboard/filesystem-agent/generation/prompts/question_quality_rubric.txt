## QUALITY RUBRIC FOR FILE NAVIGATION BENCHMARK

### 1. COMPLEXITY TIERS

- **Too Easy (REJECT)**:
  - 1-2 file lookups
  - Can be solved with 1-2 grep commands
  - Simple "find person by X, look up Y" chains
  - Example: "What is the name of person with ID pers-0001?"
  - Example: "What pet does the person with plate XYZ own?" (just 2 hops)

- **Medium (ACCEPT)**:
  - 3 file lookups with a clear chain
  - Requires at least one non-trivial step (filtering, comparing within a small group)
  - Example: "What job does the person with the earliest expiring Visa card have?"
  - Example: "Among the 4 employees at X Corp, who owns the most vehicles?"

- **Hard (ACCEPT, PREFERRED)**:
  - 4-5 file lookups
  - Requires reasoning: aggregation, comparison, set intersection, negation, or temporal logic
  - Example: "What is the total bank balance of the person who owns plate XYZ and has a Mastercard?"
  - Example: "Among people with O+ blood who own dogs, who has the highest salary? If tied, who is oldest?"
  - Example: "Between the owner of plate ABC and the person with SSN ending 789, who has more pets?"

### 2. ANSWER QUALITY

- **REJECT if answer is**:
  - A negation: "does not own", "None", "no record found"
  - Ambiguous: person has multiple matching records (2 dogs, 2 jobs)
  - A list without clear ordering: "Dog and Cat" (which one?)

- **ACCEPT if answer is**:
  - A specific name: "John Smith"
  - A specific number: "$145,315.33", "4 vehicles", "3"
  - A specific date: "2025-06-19"
  - A specific identifier: "prg-64550245"

### 3. GREP-ABILITY

- **Not Feasible (REJECT)**:
  - Requires scanning ALL 500 people
  - Needs exact counting across hundreds of records
  - Complex math that grep cannot approximate
  - Example: "What is the average bank balance across all people?"

- **Feasible (ACCEPT)**:
  - Starts with a specific identifier or small group (3-15 people)
  - Each step narrows candidates using grep-able patterns
  - Counting within a group of 3-10 records
  - Example: "Among the 5 employees at X Corp, who has the most credit cards?"

### 4. AMBIGUITY CHECK

- **REJECT if**:
  - Question asks about "the dog" but person has multiple dogs
  - Question asks about "the job title" but person has 2 jobs
  - Multiple people could be the correct answer
  - The filtering conditions don't narrow to exactly 1 person

- **ACCEPT if**:
  - Question specifies which record: "the oldest vehicle", "the highest-balance account"
  - Person has exactly 1 of the asked-about record type
  - Exactly 1 person satisfies all conditions

### 5. EVALUATION APPROACH

For each question:
1. Read the question, SQL queries, and answer carefully
2. Verify the answer is unique (exactly 1 correct answer)
3. Check ambiguity (no multi-record confusion)
4. Verify minimum 3 files are required
5. Assess difficulty tier (prefer Hard over Medium)
6. Ensure the answer is a concrete value, not a negation
