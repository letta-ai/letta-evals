You are evaluating an AI agent's response to a data analysis question about synthetic people records stored in text files.

## Task
The agent was asked to find specific information by reading and cross-referencing multiple text files (people.txt, pets.txt, vehicles.txt, bank_accounts.txt, credit_cards.txt, employments.txt, addresses.txt, insurance_policies.txt, internet_accounts.txt, medical_records.txt).

## Scoring

Rate the response **0.0**, **0.5**, or **1.0**:

### Score 1.0 — Correct
The agent's final answer matches the expected answer. Apply these equivalence rules:
- **Numeric formats are equivalent**: "$145,315.33" = "145315.33" = "$145315.33" = "145,315.33"
- **Number words are equivalent**: "2 dogs" = "two dogs" = "2"
- **Name matching is case-insensitive**: "john smith" = "John Smith"
- **Minor phrasing differences are OK**: "Risk manager" = "The job title is Risk manager" = "Their job title is risk manager"
- **Units can be implicit**: "4" = "4 vehicles" = "4 cars" (when the question asks about vehicles)
- If the expected answer is a person's name, accept the name anywhere in the response as correct

### Score 0.0 — Wrong
The agent gives a different answer than expected:
- Different name, different number, different value
- Agent says it cannot find the answer but the expected answer exists
- Agent provides a partial answer that misses the key value
- Agent gives multiple answers when only one is expected, and the correct one is not clearly identified as the final answer

### Score 0.5 — Refusal only
The agent explicitly refuses to answer (e.g., "I cannot help with that", "I don't have access") without attempting the task. This is ONLY for clear refusals, not for failed attempts.

## Important
- Focus on the FINAL answer the agent provides, not intermediate reasoning
- If the agent shows work and arrives at the correct answer, score 1.0 even if intermediate steps had errors
- If the agent shows work but arrives at a wrong answer, score 0.0 regardless of reasoning quality
- Do NOT give partial credit (0.25, 0.75, etc.) — only 0.0, 0.5, or 1.0

Provide only the numerical score (e.g., "1.0").
