Recognizability and silhouette (0.20)  \n   0.20: Clear silhouette; core anatomy reads at a glance (in monospaced font)  \n   0.10: Recognizable with effort; proportions or anatomy are a bit off  \n   0.00: Unrecognizable\n\n4.

Effort / \u201cbest version\u201d signal (0.10): The art is multi-line and detailed, showing effort. (0.10)\n\nTotal: 1.0. However, the rubric says to use exactly one send_message tool, but the submission does not show the tool call, only the output. If the context is that the tool call is implicit and only the output is shown, then this is a perfect submission. If the tool call is required to be visible, a small deduction would be warranted. Given the context, I will deduct 0.05 for possible ambiguity, resulting in a score of 0.95.",
