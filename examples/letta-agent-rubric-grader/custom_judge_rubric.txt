1. **Correctness (0.6 weight)**: Does the response contain accurate information from the webpage? Check if the answer matches what was requested in the input.

2. **Format (0.2 weight)**: Is the response formatted correctly? The input often requests answers in a specific format (e.g., in brackets like {Answer}).
